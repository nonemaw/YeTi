<:if str(superfund.valueOf('smsf_investment_strategy')) in ['Secure']:>
SECURE
	Secure
Investment Objective	To provide a consistent level of income and preserve capital over the short term.
Strategy	This investment strategy provides for a substantial investment in defensive assets such as cash and fixed interest assets, with little or no investment in growth assets.
Risk	The risk profile of the fund is low over the short term, with emphasis being on generation of income and preservation of capital.
This strategy is suitable for those who seek regular income returns and are prepared to accept lower overall returns over time with lower levels of volatility in order to preserve capital over the short term.

Asset sector	Minimum (%)	Maximum (%)
Growth	0	10
Defensive	90	100

<:end:>
<:if str(superfund.valueOf('smsf_investment_strategy')) in ['Conservative Growth']:>
CONSERVATIVE GROWTH
	Conservative Growth
Investment Objective	To provide a consistent level of income while retaining the ability to achieve some capital growth over the short to medium term.
Strategy	This investment strategy provides for the majority of investments in defensive assets whilst providing some scope for investment in growth assets.
Risk	The risk profile of the fund is lower over the short term, with emphasis being on generation of income with the potential to achieve some capital growth. Investment in growth assets may result in some capital losses but the investments in defensive assets should act to limit losses of the portfolio.
This strategy is suitable for those who seek regular income returns but who are prepared to accept a low level of volatility in capital values from year to year to achieve some capital growth.

Asset sector	Minimum (%)	Maximum (%)
Growth	0	30
Defensive	70	100

<:end:>
<:if str(superfund.valueOf('smsf_investment_strategy')) in ['Balanced Growth']:>
BALANCED GROWTH
	Balanced Growth
Investment Objective	To provide moderate levels of income and capital growth over the medium term.
Strategy	This investment strategy provides for a balance of investments in growth and defensive assets.
Risk	The risk profile of the fund ranks as medium. While it is possible that some growth assets may provide a loss in the short term the investments in defensive assets should act to reduce losses of the portfolio.
This strategy is suitable for those who seek a moderate level of income and capital growth over periods of, typically, 3 to 5 years with a medium level of volatility in investment returns and asset values in the short term.

Asset sector	Minimum (%)	Maximum (%)
Growth	30	70
Defensive	30	70

<:if str(superfund.valueOf('smsf_investment_strategy')) in ['Growth']:>
GROWTH
	Growth
Investment Objective	To provide higher levels of capital growth over the medium to long term.
Strategy	This investment strategy provides for the majority of investments in growth assets whilst providing some scope for investment in defensive assets.
Risk	The risk profile of the fund is medium to high over the short term. Growth assets consistent with this strategy exhibit price volatility. It is possible that investments may provide a loss in the short to medium term.
This strategy is suitable for those who seek a higher level of overall return over periods in excess of, typically, 5 years and who are prepared to accept a higher level of volatility in investment returns and asset values in the short to medium term.

Asset sector	Minimum (%)	Maximum (%)
Growth	50	80
Defensive	20	50

<:end:>
<:if str(superfund.valueOf('smsf_investment_strategy')) in ['High Growth']:>
HIGH GROWTH
	High Growth
Investment Objective	To maximise capital growth over the long term.
Strategy	This investment strategy provides for a substantial investment in growth assets such as equities and property assets, with only a small allocation towards defensive assets.
Risk	The risk profile of the fund is the highest over the short term. Growth assets consistent with this strategy exhibit price volatility. It is possible that investments may provide a loss in the medium term.
This strategy is suitable for those with a long-term investment horizon and who seek higher levels of overall return. Investors need to be prepared to accept higher levels of volatility in investment returns and asset values in the medium term.

PROJECTIONS AND ANALYSIS
This scenario models the outcome if the current/recommended situation prevails.
<:=$docnote('XMERGE Library/New Business SOA/Projections’, part=’Projections and Analysis.doc’):>
ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS
The modelling suggests that your <<investments, superannuation and pension assets>> will be sufficient/insufficient in generating the income required to meet your income requirements of $XXX per annum throughout your retirement years.
SURPLUS INCOME
We recommend the income surplus is reinvested back into the overall/investment portfolio to allow for further growth in the portfolio. Hence, the capital value of the overall/investment portfolio (as represented by the blue shaded area) is expected to increase over the projected period.
<<Add other recommendations for surplus income. >>
INCOME DEFICIT
<<As a result, it will be necessary to supplement this income deficit with capital drawdowns from the overall/investment portfolio. Hence, the capital value of the overall/investment portfolio (as represented by the blue shaded area) is expected to decrease over the projected period.  <<We therefore, recommend you should reduce your expenditure to ensure your portfolio lasts to the projected period.>>
<Insert here which goals cannot be achieved within the timeframe> e.g. Based on our assessment, it is unlikely you will achieve the goal of retiring in 3 years as you do not have sufficient assets accumulated by age 62, and therefore <Add what alternatives adviser has recommended for client’s consideration>
e.g. Retire 5 years later at age xx, reduce current expenditure to $xx p.a

Assumptions:
•	The modelling begins 1 July 20XX.
•	Inflation at 2.50% per annum.
•	Lifestyles expenses is $XXX per annum.
•	The portfolios are invested in line with a ‘XXX  (including/excluding alternatives)’ risk profile, which aims to generate capital growth of X.X% and income return of X.X% per annum (franking levels of XX.X%) over the long term.
•	All fees relating to the management of the portfolio, accounting and legal fees are tax deductible.
•	We have <<included/excluded>> Centrelink entitlements in our analysis.
•	All Perpetual ongoing management fees and ongoing investment fees are also included.
•	The projection above only includes the superannuation and pension assets that will be managed by Perpetual. It does not include any Lifestyle assets that you may have. such as the holiday home, principal place of residence, etc.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROJECTIONS
•	The green bars represent your total inflows, including <<employment income, income generated from your investments, and any other sources of income>>.
•	The red bars represent your total outflows, including <<lifestyle expenses, planned capital expenditures, estimated tax payable and any other outgoings>> .
•	The blue shaded area represents the net capital value of your assets, including <<personal, superannuation and pension assets>>.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND PROJECTIONS

The following tables illustrate the projection of your cashflow, assets and liabilities <<after allowing for fees>>, investment income and capital spending (where relevant). The present day value estimates have been produced as a guide to help assess the effects of inflation over time and to provide an indication of the real value of your portfolio (i.e. the projections are expressed in 'today's' dollars).
The values projected in the tables which follow are based on financial years that is, from the 1st of July to the
30th June. Year 1 relates to the balance of the financial year commencing <<1 July 2017>>>>. Generally, growth investments require a timeframe of at least five years for performance objectives to be confidently achieved and our projections of your portfolio value over a lesser period are subject to significant variation.

ABOUT YOUR STRATEGIES
Additional information on the strategies recommended in your financial plan have been provided below:

GEARING
Gearing is a strategy used to accelerate wealth accumulation and involves borrowing money to invest. By gearing you can effectively reduce the initial cash outlay required in order to obtain a certain level of investment exposure. The impact of this is that profits or losses on a position are magnified in percentage terms.
Gearing is most appropriate for people:
With an assertive or aggressive risk profile, who are prepared to accept investment volatility;
With a strong, secure cash-flow (which is protected by an adequate and appropriate insurance policy);
On higher marginal tax rates, and
Who have an investment time-frame of greater than 7 years..
TYPES OF GEARING
PROPERTY EQUITY LOAN (LUMP-SUM OR INSTALMENT)
A property equity loan is a loan facility that uses any real property you own as security. Notably, by utilising the equity in your home in this way, you can access more competitive interest rates to finance your investments. For many, this type of finance is preferred to a margin loan, as it will often have fewer restrictions, is less complex to administer, has lower risk and is generally subject to a lower interest rate.
MARGIN LOAN (LUMP-SUM OR INSTALMENT)
A margin loan is a loan facility secured by a portfolio of securities, most commonly shares and interests in managed funds. Margin lending is similar to traditional home ownership, where the lender requires that the investor put up some of his or her capital to cover the financial risk of the underlying asset being sold at a loss.
BENEFITS OF GEARING
Gearing provides the opportunity to make larger investments that would not be possible if you were using only your own funds, and the opportunity to spread your money across a greater range of assets.
Interest and related borrowing costs are generally tax-deductible, if they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. You should consult your tax adviser concerning specific investments and note that Perpetual can assist you in this respect.
Where the interest cost exceeds the income from the investment portfolio, the resulting income loss can usually be used to offset income from other sources. This is referred to as ‘negative-gearing’.
The interest cost of a property equity loan is normally less than a margin loan, and there are no margin calls.
Gearing potentially allows you to achieve returns on investments, after tax and all costs associated with gearing, in excess of the returns that could be achieved without gearing.
Gearing by instalments enables you to invest on a regular basis using a combination of your own funds and money borrowed through a loan facility. By investing at regular intervals, you apply a disciplined approach to accumulating wealth over the medium to long-term and can take advantage of the effect of compounding.
RISKS OF GEARING
The risks associated with gearing may mean it is unsuitable for some investors. It is essential to carefully consider these risks and to seek taxation advice before proceeding with a gearing strategy (note that Perpetual can assist you in this respect).
Gearing is a long-term investment strategy (minimum 7 to 10 years) and a loss may occur if you withdraw/sell in the short-term.
Gearing multiplies your investment power, but it also magnifies the risks. The risks increase because, if the value of your investment portfolio falls, both the initial capital and the borrowed funds will lose value, but the full amount of the loan will still have to be repaid. The following table provides an example.
	Geared	Non-Geared
Investor equity	$40,000	$40,000
Amount borrowed	$60,000	$0
Total Investment 	$100,000	$40,000

Market rises by 10%
Value of portfolio	$110,000	$44,000
Loan outstanding	$60,000	$0
Investors equity	$50,000	$44,000
Proportional gain in investors equity	25%	10%

Market falls by 10%
Value of portfolio	$90,000	$36,000
Loan outstanding	$60,000	$0
Investors equity	$30,000	$36,000
Proportional loss in investors equity	(25%)	(10%)

Fluctuations in the value of your portfolio will occur (both increases and decreases). However, these fluctuations are only realised when you actually sell or otherwise dispose of your investment.
Despite the fact that interest rates may move up or down during the term of the loan, you must still continue to meet your loan repayments.
If you become ill or unable to work for some unforeseen reason, then, regardless of your income position, you must still continue to meet your loan repayments.
The income returns from a geared portfolio are unlikely to exceed the interest expense associated with a loan. Thus, you should not expect to rely on income from the proposed investment to meet your loan repayments.
Due to the nature of investments, the value of your geared portfolio will move up and down and there is no guarantee of future performance or return of capital.
While the interest expense associated with money that has been borrowed for investment purposes is generally tax-deductible, it is possible that the relevant tax laws could be changed or that the Commissioner of Taxation could adopt an alternate view. If this occurs, then some or all of the interest costs may become non-deductible.
With margin loans, margin calls may be made if the value of the portfolio reduces below specified limits.
If you default on your loan, the lender may compel you to make repayments and/or impose a penalty.
HOW CAN YOU MITIGATE THE RISKS?
Despite the risks discussed above, gearing can offer real rewards for investors who are prepared to tolerate them and accept that gearing is a long-term strategy.
In order to manage the risks associated with gearing, you can:
Operate your geared portfolio through the <<Perpetual Portfolio Service or Perpetual Select Investment Fund>>, so that your portfolio can be managed and monitored on an ongoing basis;
Invest in a well-diversified portfolio;
Reinvest all the dividends and distributions you receive in the geared portfolio account;
<<insert if applicable >> Use the credit available to you through your property mortgage purely for investment purposes;
Adopt a long-term investment-horizon for this strategy e.g 7 years; and
Implement appropriate and adequate risk insurances.

Interest and related borrowing costs are generally tax deductible, if they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. You should consult your tax adviser concerning specific investments and note that Perpetual can assist you in this respect.
Where the interest cost exceeds the income from the investment portfolio, the resulting income loss can usually be used to offset income from other sources in the current (or future) financial year. This is referred to as ‘negative gearing’.
The interest cost of a property equity loan is normally less than a margin loan, and there are no margin calls.
Gearing by instalments enables you to invest on a regular basis using a combination of the trust’s own funds and money borrowed through a margin loan facility.

Proportional loss in investors equity	(25%)	(10%)

Fluctuations in the value of your portfolio will occur (both increases and decreases). However, these fluctuations are only realised when you actually sell or otherwise dispose of your investment.
Despite the fact that interest rates may move up or down during the term of the loan, you must still continue to meet your loan repayments.
If the trust relies on additional contributions to trust capital from other individuals in order meet its ongoing interest repayments, and those individuals become ill, unable to work for some unforeseen reason or are otherwise experiencing financial difficulties, then, regardless of its income position, the trust must still continue to meet its loan repayments.
The income returns from a geared portfolio are unlikely to exceed the interest expense associated  with a loan. Thus, you should not expect to rely on income from the proposed investment to meet loan repayments.
Due to the nature of investments, the value of your geared portfolio will move up and down and there is no guarantee of future performance or return of capital.
Where a borrowing is undertaken by the trustee of a trust whose assessable income is insufficient to absorb all of its deductions, then any losses it derives will be able to be carried forward indefinitely and applied against its assessable income in later years. Trust losses are, therefore, ‘trapped’ in the trust and cannot be distributed to beneficiaries.
While the interest expense associated with money that has been borrowed for investment purposes is generally tax deductible, it is possible that the relevant tax laws could be changed or that the Commissioner of Taxation could adopt an alternate view. If this occurs, then some or all of the interest costs may become non-deductible.

GENUINE REDUNDANCY PACKAGE
A genuine redundancy payment is a payment made to a dismissed employee who has received an amount that exceeds what would have been received had they voluntarily terminated their employment.
More specifically the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has identified four necessary requirements before a payment from an employer can be deemed a ‘genuine redundancy payment’. These include:
The payment being tested must be received in consequence of an employee’s termination.
That termination must involve the employee being dismissed from employment.
That dismissal must be caused by the redundancy of the employee’s position.
The redundancy payment must be made genuinely because of a redundancy.
In addition to the above conditions it is also necessary that:
The dismissed employee is less than age 65 at the time of dismissal.
The termination is not in relation to the completion of a set period of service.
The amount paid is not greater than what could be expected had those involved been dealing at arms length.
There is no arrangement to employ the dismissed employ post termination.
The payment has not been made in lieu of a superannuation benefit.

ESTABLISHING A SELF MANAGED SUPER FUND
Generally, a superannuation fund is an SMSF if:
it has less than five members;
all members are eligible to be a trustee
no member of the fund is an employee of another member of the fund, unless they are related;
each member is a trustee and each trustee is a member (there is a special rule for single member funds); and
no trustee of the fund receives any remuneration for their services as a trustee.
An SMSF can have a corporate trustee if:
the fund has less than five members;
each member of the fund is a director of the company and each director of the company is a member of the fund (there is a special rule for single member funds);
each director is eligible to be a trustee
no member of the fund is an employee of another member of the fund, unless they are related;
the corporate trustee does not receive any remuneration for its services as a trustee; and
no director of the corporate trustee receives any remuneration for their services as a director in relation to the fund.
To establish your SMSF, you will need to:
a.	identify the members and confirm their eligibility
b.	execute a trust deed and appoint service providers
c.	formulate an investment strategy for the fund
d.	lodge a notice to become a regulated superannuation fund and execute and retain trustee’s declarations
e.	apply for a Tax File Number and (potentially) make application for GST registration, and
f.	open a bank account and make rollovers/contributions to the fund.
A. IDENTIFYING THE MEMBERS
Generally, anyone 18 years of age and over, and who is not under a legal disability, can be a trustee of a superannuation fund, unless they are a disqualified person.
An individual is a disqualified person if they:
have ever been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty
have ever been subject to a civil penalty order under the SIS Act
are an insolvent under administration (eg. an undischarged bankrupt), or
if they have been disqualified by a regulator.
A company would not be permitted to act as trustee if:
it knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that one of its responsible officers is a disqualified person (a responsible person includes a director, secretary or executive officer)
a receiver, official manager or provisional liquidator has been appointed to the company, or
if action has commenced to wind up the company.
The following table compares the differences between an individual trustee and a corporate trustee:
INDIVIDUAL TRUSTEE	CORPORATE TRUSTEE
•	single member funds require a second individual trustee
•	new member(s) must be appointed trustee
•	no additional costs to establish individual trustees for the fund
•	exiting member(s) must resign as trustee(s)
•	additional administration required to notify offices and registries of change in ownership of assets when there is a change in trusteeship
•	must maintain a clear separation of assets of the fund from personal assets of member/trustee
•	unlimited liability
•	administration disruption on death may arise
•	cost effective
•	penalties for non-compliance	•	single member funds can operate with sole director
•	new members must be appointed directors
•	exiting member(s) must resign as director(s)
•	administrative efficiency as no change in ownership of assets required despite changes to membership
•	clear separation of asset ownership with sole purpose trustee company
•	limited liability
•	no administration disruption on death
•	flexibility in estate planning
•	additional establishment and ongoing costs
•	additional penalties for non-compliance may apply

Please refer to ATO website for more information.
B. TRUST DEED
Following are examples of matters you should consider including in your SMSF Trust Deed.
Provision for the admission of up to four members and the definition of who can become a member
How someone becomes a member e.g. on receipt of a completed application in the prescribed form (often incorporated as a schedule to the deed)
The circumstances in which a member’s membership will cease, eg. when all of the member’s benefits have been transferred or rolled-over to another fund or paid out (preferably, subject to the trustee’s discretion to determine otherwise) or the member dies
Provide for the appointment of each member as an individual trustee or director of a corporate trustee and the circumstance by which others, including non-members, can become a trustee, eg. upon death of a member
How a trustee is appointed or removed
The types of contributions that can be accepted or prohibited e.g. non-concessional contributions from members who have not provided their tax file numbers
The division of superannuation interests on marriage breakdown
Limited recourse borrowing arrangements including permission to pledge, appoint a custodian and enter such into an SMSF borrowing arrangement
Whether or not investment reserves can be established
The types of benefits permitted to be paid from the fund and in what circumstance
Winding up provisions
Review cycle of the trust deed, and
Appointment of auditors and service providers.
C. FORMULATING AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Please refer to the Investment Section contained in Important Notes.
D. NOTICE TO BECOME A REGULATED SUPERANNUATION FUND AND EXECUTION OF TRUSTEE’S DECLARATIONS
Prior to registering an SMSF with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), it must be legally established (by executing the trust deed and setting aside assets for the benefit of members) and all trustees must have signed a trustee declaration.
The trustee declaration must be completed within 21 days of becoming a new trustee (or director of a corporate trustee) of:
a new self managed super fund (SMSF), or
an existing SMSF.
It must also be completed if you are a legal personal representative who has been appointed as trustee (or director of a corporate trustee) on behalf of a:
member who is under a legal disability (an individual under 18 years of age)
member for whom you hold an enduring power of attorney, or
a deceased member.
The trustee declarations must be retained for 10 years.
The election to be a regulated fund is part of the registration process and must be made within 60 days of establishing an SMSF.
E. TAX FILE NUMBER AND GST REGISTRATION
Once the ATO has accepted your registration, you will be issued with a TFN and Australian business number (ABN). It will then be able to register for goods and services tax (GST), if required.
F. OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT
The trustee must keep the money and assets of the fund separate from other money and assets, eg.from their personal assets. Therefore it is important that the fund’s bank account is opened and operated only for this purpose.
TRUSTEE RESPONSIBILITIES
The role of the trustee is to hold the fund’s assets on behalf of its members and their beneficiaries, until such time they become eligible to receive a benefit, eg. at retirement.
The trustees must comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act), which imposes minimum requirements, the duties imposed on all trustees under trust law in general.
The SIS Act binds trustees to:
Act honestly in all matters concerning the fund
Exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as an ordinary prudent person in managing the fund
Act in the best interest of all fund beneficiaries
Keep the money and assets of the fund separate from other money and assets, eg.from their personal assets
Retain control over the fund
Formulate and implement an investment strategy
Not enter into contracts or behave in a way that hinders them from performing or exercising their functions or powers, and
Allow members of the fund access to certain information.
Therefore it is important that all SMSF trustees, whether as individuals or directors of a corporate trustee, understand their duties and responsibilities. Indeed, when a new SMSF is established, all of its trustees must sign a declaration acknowledging the above (and similarly whenever new trustees are appointed to an existing fund).
INVESTMENTS
The trustees must formulate, implement and regularly review the investment strategy of the fund, taking into account the SIS Act restrictions on the type of assets that trustees of SMSFs can invest in.
When preparing an investment strategy, the trustees must determine the investment objectives of the fund, as well as the investment methods by which the investment objectives will be achieved, based on the following principles:
To maximise the return to members, taking into account the risks associated with the holding of different types of investments
To consider the benefits of diversifying the investments of the fund
To ensure the fund has sufficient cash liquidity at any given time to pay member benefits and other costs incurred, as they become payable, and
To consider whether the fund should hold insurance cover for its members.
COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
SMSF’s are regulated by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and, unlike APRA-regulated superannuation funds, are not eligible for financial assistance if the fund suffers a loss due to fraudulent conduct or theft, committed by members of the fund. Compensation for losses would need to be pursued through other avenues, such as a court of law.
OTHER
With an SMSF, the responsibility for compliance with the various superannuation regulations and laws rests with the trustees (or the directors of its corporate trustee). This includes responsibility for
Amendments of trust deeds resulting from legislative change
Recording and maintaining minutes of trustee decisions, and
Ensuring the fund structure, strategies and investments comply with both the trust deed and relevant laws (which generally cannot be outsourced to an accountant).
Further, because contributions to an SMSF will not be pooled with a large number of other investors, your SMSF may have insufficient funds to be able to diversify into certain asset classes, eg. infrastructure.
Finally, and depending on the types of investments in an SMSF or the administration and consulting assistance you required, it may be expensive to maintain the fund.

FUNDING AN ASSET ACQUISITION
The following strategies may be appropriate for the funding of the acquisition of any asset within a DIY superannuation fund:
1. TIMING OF THE NORMAL CONTRIBUTION CAPS
Superannuation fund members should consider the amount and timing of their non-concessional contributions (NCC), in order to make the most of their annual and 3-year NCC caps. This could be done by making in specie contributions of a jointly-owned asset which is applied across the interests of the contributing members, or by making cash contributions with the superannuation fund subsequently purchasing the asset.
It is important to note that in specie contributions can give rise to capital gains tax and stamp duty liabilities for the contributing members.
2. JOINT OWNERSHIP WITH THE DIY SUPER FUND
A DIY superannuation fund can use its existing cash holdings (including member contributions), to purchase a share of an asset as a tenant-in-common with a member or third party. When members make further contributions (eg. via salary-sacrifice or with after-tax funds), then the fund could use that cash to acquire a greater proportion of the asset. Again, if the asset is acquired from a member or their associate, then it would need to be permitted under the relevant laws dealing with such acquisitions.
3. ACQUIRE THE ASSET VIA A PRIVATE NON-GEARED UNIT TRUST
A DIY superannuation fund may use member contributions to progressively acquire units in a private non- geared unit trust which, itself, owns the desired asset.
Units in a private non-geared unit trust are not considered to be in-house assets where the unit trust:
•	does not borrow;
•	does not acquire an interest in another entity;
•	has no assets with a charge over them;
•	does not lend money to individuals or other entities (other than deposits with authorised deposit-taking institutions);
•	does not acquire an asset from a member or their associate (other than business real property acquired at market value);
•	does not directly or indirectly lease assets to related parties (other than business real property);
•	does not conduct a business; and
•	conducts all transactions on an arm’s length basis.
4. DIRECT BORROWING IN YOUR DIY SUPER FUND
It is possible for the trustee of a DIY superannuation funds to borrow to acquire any asset without breaching the general prohibition on borrowing. This will be so where:
•	the borrowing is used to acquire an asset held on trust, so that the trustee receives a beneficial interest and a right (but not an obligation) to acquire the legal ownership of the asset (or any replacement) through one or more payments;
•	the lender’s recourse against the trustee of the superannuation fund, in the event of default on the borrowing, is limited to rights relating to the asset at the time of the action; and
•	the asset must be one which the trustee of the superannuation fund is permitted to acquire and hold directly, ie. the existing investment restrictions (such as those on in-house assets and acquiring certain assets from a related party of the fund) continue to apply.
An asset acquired pursuant to an arrangement that meets these conditions will only be an in-house asset, where the asset itself would be an in-house asset if it were held directly (ie. the acquisition of business real property from a member or their associate is permitted.

SELF MANAGED SUPER FUND INVESTMENT RULES
THE SOLE PURPOSE TEST
One of the most important aspects of the law relating to the investment of superannuation trust fund money is the “sole purpose test”. Essentially, this test states that trustees of superannuation funds are obliged to make investment decisions with the primary purpose of generating retirement benefits for the members of those funds, for providing benefits for each member of the fund on reaching age 65, or for providing benefits for the legal personal representatives or the member’s dependents on or after the death of the member.
The trustees may also have the following ancillary purposes, but they must be in conjunction with one of the core purposes listed above:
The provision of benefits to a member of a fund after the termination of the member's employment (which includes resignation or redundancy) from an employer who had, or any of whose associates had, at any time contributed to the fund in relation to the member; and
The provision of benefits where a member ceases work for gain or reward on account of ill health.
ARM’S LENGTH INVESTMENTS AND DEALINGS
The trustee of a DIY superannuation fund must ensure that its investments are made and maintained on an arm’s length basis. Although this does not prohibit transactions with related or associated parties, it does mean that such must be on a commercial basis, unless the transactions are more beneficial to the superannuation fund than would otherwise be the case.
LENDING AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
The trustees of DIY superannuation funds must not lend money of the fund, nor give any other financial assistance using the resources of the fund, to a member or a relative of a member.
The concept of financial assistance is very wide and could take the form of the giving of a security, charge or guarantee or the taking on of an obligation, or any other arrangement that, on an objective assessment of its purpose, is financial accommodation. Other examples of where arrangements or transactions contravene these rules are where the trustees:
Give a gift using the fund’s resources to a member.
Sell a fund asset to a member for less than its market value.
Purchase an asset from a member for greater than its market value.
Provide security or a charge over fund assets or give a guarantee for the benefit of a member.
Forgive a debt of a member.
Satisfy or take on a financial obligation of a member.
BORROWINGS
The trustees of DIY superannuation funds are prohibited from borrowing money or maintaining an existing borrowing, except in limited circumstances where the borrowing does not exceed 10% of the fund’s total assets and:
It is for a maximum of 90 days, to meet benefit payments due to members or a surcharge liability.
Is for a maximum of seven days, to cover the settlement of security transactions.
There is also a significant exception to the general prohibition, in respect of borrowings that meet certain conditions found in limited recourse borrowing arrangements.
ACQUISITIONS FROM RELATED PARTIES
The trustees of DIY superannuation funds are generally prohibited from acquiring assets from related parties. Exceptions to this rule exist, including where the assets are acquired at market value and are listed securities, units in widely held unit trusts or business real property.
IN-HOUSE ASSETS
Another important aspect of the law relating to the investment of superannuation trust fund money are the rules surrounding “in-house” assets. An in-house asset of a superannuation fund is defined to include:
A loan to a related party of the fund.
An investment in a related party or a related trust of the fund.
An asset of the fund subject to a lease or lease arrangement between the trustees of the fund and a related party of the fund.
A related party is defined to include a member, a trustee and an employer who contributes into the fund under an arrangement with the trustees of the fund. It also includes a number of people and entities that are in some way connected to the fund and its members or employer sponsors, including:
Any relative of a member.
A partnership where a member or employer sponsor is a partner.
Any company or trust that is controlled or sufficiently influenced by a member of the fund or employer sponsor.
The in-house asset rules limit a DIY superannuation fund to holding no more than 5% of its assets as in- house assets, based on market value.
CHARGING ASSETS
The trustees of DIY superannuation funds are generally restricted from creating a charge on fund member’s interests and on fund assets.
This restriction does not apply to an asset that is part of a limited recourse borrowing arrangements and to derivative investment products which derive their value from an underlying security, liability or index (eg. options, futures and warrants). The use of derivatives must be specified in the fund’s investment strategy and, if required, a derivatives risk statement must be prepared. The restriction would, however, apply to some types of 'contracts for difference', ie those which feature a charge being given over their underlying asset.

WINDING UP A SELF MANAGED SUPER FUND
WINDING UP YOUR SELF-MANAGED SUPERANNUATION FUND (SMSF)
Trustees have several legal obligations they must follow, where they decide to wind up their SMSF. In summary, winding up a SMS fund requires dealing with all of its assets so that none remain within the fund, and completing all of the reporting and other trustee administrative obligations as part of the closure process.
WHY A SMSF MAY NEED TO BE WOUND UP
Some common reasons include:
the trustees’ circumstances have changed, leaving them unable to attend to the ongoing management and running of their fund (including having the time to spend liaising with other advice professionals)
there are no longer any members/trustees within the SMSF (for example, they may have rolled their benefits to another fund or have passed away)
the fund has a zero balance
one or more of the SMSF trustees have relocated overseas
there are insufficient funds in the SMSF to meet the ongoing administration costs.
Indeed, when a new SMSF is established, all of its trustees must sign a declaration acknowledging the above (and similarly whenever new trustees are appointed to an existing fund).
STEPS TO WINDING UP AN SMSF
Trustee of SMSF’s who are seeking to wind up their fund should firstly refer to its trust deed, as it will often contain vital information about the process. Where the deed is silent on a particular matter, further advice may need to be obtained, or the deed upgraded prior to winding up the fund.
It is important to wind up a fund correctly. If trustees you have not met all of their obligations and their fund is selected for compliance investigation by the regulator, the trustees may be subject to penalties.
DEALING WITH BENEFITS
Prior to any benefits being payable to the members of an SMSF being wound up, they must meet a “condition of release’ allowing them to access their benefits. If a member does not meet a condition of release or does not want to access their benefits at the time the fund winds up, the benefits will need to be rolled over to another complying super fund.
Where an eligible member is to receive a benefit directly, the trustees of the SMSF you do not need to withhold tax from that payment, if the benefit is:
from a taxed source being paid as either a super income stream or a lump sum, and being received by a member who is 60 years old or over at the time of the payment, or
being paid as a lump sum because the member has a certified terminal medical condition.
There may be capital gains implications on the disposal of assets when superannuation benefits are paid or rolled over to another fund. Trustees should consult with their financial adviser or the ATO.
WHAT YOU MUST AND MUST NOT DO
DO	DO NOT
Contact the ATO to find out if there are any remaining liabilities or refund requests due.
Ensure all activity statements are up to date	Cancel your ABN, this will be done by the ATO
Ensure all assets and member contributions have
been dealt with as required by superannuation laws and the trust deed
Have an audit conducted by an approved auditor for your fund’s income year. This needs to be completed to enable lodgement of the fund’s annual return.
Lodge the fund’s final annual return and answer all questions about its wind up:
1. Was the fund wound up during the income year? Answer ‘yes’.
2. On what date did the fund wind up? Provide a date between 1 July and 30 June of the income year.
3. Have all tax lodgement and payment obligations been met?
Tax liabilities (including the final SMSF levy) can be prepaid or paid with lodgement of the annual return.	Wind up the fund before all lodgement and payment obligations have been finalised
Notify the ATO in writing within 28 days of the fund being wound up and provide the following information:
1. the name of the SMSF
2. the ABN of the SMSF
3. a contact person, including their name, phone and fax number, and
4. the date the fund was wound up.	Close your bank accounts until all expected final liabilities have been settled and requested refunds are received

SMSFS V SAFS
Superannuation funds are vehicles used to own assets for the purposes of the retirement of their members. They exist in various forms and, when they are complying with the relevant laws, are subject to taxation at rates that are more concessional than if the same investments were made in another environment.
The trustee of a superannuation fund holds the fund’s assets for the members and distributes its income and capital to the members when they become entitled.
As the trustee of a superannuation fund has the legal but not beneficial ownership of the fund’s assets, then an insolvent member’s creditors cannot generally claw back fund assets in any actions they take for recovery against that member.
One form of superannuation fund, which is regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, is known as a small APRA superannuation fund (SAF), which has four or less members. A SAF provides individuals with the flexibility of being able to manage their retirement investments and their estate planning needs more specifically. This is essentially achieved by the fact that the members of a SAF may be able to provide directions and instructions to its trustee.
Another form of superannuation fund, which is regulated by the Australian Taxation Office, is known as a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF), which has four or less members. An SMSF provides individuals with the flexibility of being able to manage their retirement investments and their estate planning needs more specifically. This is essentially achieved by the fact that the members of an SMSF must also be its trustees (or directors of its corporate trustee).
Although making investments in the superannuation environment can provide significant benefits, differences exist where those investments are made in an SMSF and a SAF. Some of those differences are summarised in the following table.
SAF	SMSF
Regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.	Regulated by the Australian Taxation Office.
The trustee is a third party approved by the government.	The trustees and members are essentially the same individuals.
The trustee carries liability for any potential fines and litigation.	The trustees have obligations to know and comply with any relevant superannuation, taxation and other laws, and carry liability for any potential for fines, gaol and litigation.
Arm’s length employees of members can, themselves, be members of the fund.	Members cannot be employed by other members, unless they are related to one another.
No need to change trustee on death or loss of capacity of members.	Potential need for succession planning in the event of the death or loss of capacity of members/trustees.
Trustee may effectively control the nature of investments, by virtue of approve product lists, internal policies, etc.	The trustees/members maintain absolute control over the nature of investments.

SUPERANNUATION STRUCTURE
Superannuation funds are vehicles used to own assets for the purposes of the retirement, death or disability of their members. They exist in various forms and, when they are compliant with the relevant laws, are subject to taxation at rates that are more concessional than if the same investments were made in another environment.
The trustee of a superannuation fund holds the fund’s assets for the members and distributes its income and capital to the members when they become entitled.
As the trustee of a superannuation fund has the legal but not beneficial ownership of the fund’s assets, then an insolvent member’s creditors cannot generally claw back fund assets in any actions they take for recovery against that member.
Essentially, there are four types of superannuation structures that are available.
1. RETAIL SUPERANNUATION FUNDS
These superannuation funds are often set up by a commercial fund manager. A trust deed is created which allows the fund manager to operate the fund, and the fund manager then offers its products within the superannuation environment to a wide market.
2. INDUSTRY AND MULTI-MANAGER FUNDS
Employer groups or financial services providers often establish superannuation funds by creating a trust deed that allows an administrator to run them. The administrator then appoints a team (in industry funds, these are often elected members) to research and select a range of fund managers to manage the superannuation monies.
3. DISCRETIONARY MASTER TRUSTS
A discretionary master trust is a superannuation fund established by a financial services provider. The provider will offer investors a comprehensive suite of assets that they are prepared to allow them to hold within such a structure. Typically, these types of trusts will vary in cost and flexibility..
4. DIY FUNDS
Where an individual has significant amounts invested in the superannuation environment, it can be advantageous that they establish and operate their own superannuation fund. This allows individuals to have significant (if not absolute) control over the investments that their fund will hold, as well as being able to take full advantage of the benefits that superannuation can offer. DIY (or Do-It-Yourself) superannuation funds are generally classified as self-managed superannuation funds and small-APRA funds.

SMSF – PENSIONS OPERATION RULES
Subject to the trust deed governing the fund, the trustees of DIY superannuation funds are only able to commence the following pensions:
Non-commutable (transitional) account based pensions.
Ordinary (fully commutable) account based pensions.
Market linked income steam (arising from the commutation of an existing complying income stream).
DIY superannuation funds may continue to pay the following pensions commenced before 30 June 2007
Allocated pensions.
Non commutable allocated pensions.
Complying pensions such as market linked income streams.
Pensioners continue to be eligible for a 50% assets test exemption for social security purposes, for existing income streams purchased before 20 September 2007, as well as a 100% exemption for those purchased before 20 September 2004.
Any trust deed executed prior to May 2006 may be severely limited in terms of its capability to make such payments and, therefore, should be immediately reviewed.
Subject to the relevant trust deed, there are typically nine steps in the commencement, compliance and operation of DIY superannuation fund pensions:
1	Determine what type of pension and/or lump sum is optimal for the member.
2	Review the trust deed to determine whether it mandates any procedural requirements to commence  the pension. If it doesn’t, then a procedure will need to be resolved.
3	The member makes application to the trustees for the commencement of a pension. This includes details of how much is to be used to commence the pension and when it will start.
4	The trustees resolve what investment strategy is to be used to support the pension and whether an actuary needs to be consulted.
5	The trustees resolve on setting the investment strategy and offering the pension to the member in writing.
6	The member considers the offer and notifies the trustees.
7	The trustees resolve to commence the pension and make the relevant investments to support it.
8	The fund should register for PAYG withholding tax should the member expect to receive a pension payment before attaining age 60.
9	If the member is below age 60 he or she provide the trustee with a completed TFN declaration form ensuring that the trustees can calculate the amount of tax to withhold; and
10 The arrangement is reviewed periodically by the adviser and the trustees.

AGED CARE
ACCOMMODATION PAYMENTS
Prior to 1 July 2014, individuals entering a nursing home would be required to pay an on-going accommodation charge. Individuals entering a hostel or extra service nursing home were asked to pay an accommodation bond. Payment of the bond could be made as a lump-sum, periodic payment, or combination of both.
From 1 July 2014, individuals entering residential care may be asked to pay an accommodation payment. The payment could be made as a:
1.    lump-sum referred to as a 'refundable accommodation deposit' (RAD) 2.    periodic payment referred to as a 'daily accommodation payment' (DAP), or 3.    a combination of RAD and DAP.
Where a combination of RAD and DAP is selected, the facility may offer the option of deducting the DAP payable from the RAD already paid.
On leaving the facility, the RAD (less any DAP amounts deducted) will be refunded to the individual or their estate. Notably, where a RAD is reducing due to a DAP being deducted, the facility may request that the RAD be topped-up at some future stage, or they may also agree to a higher DAP in lieu of such a top-up.
ONGOING FEES
Individuals who entered residential care prior to 1 July 2014 are required to pay a 'basic daily fee' and, depending on their level of income, an 'income-tested fee'.
Individuals who enter care on or after 1 July 2014 are required to pay a 'basic daily fee' and, depending on their level of income and assets, a 'means-tested fee'. The means-tested fee includes an income-tested component and an asset-tested component.
Residents who choose a premium standard of care, or who elect to receive certain extra services, may be required to pay 'extra service fees'
Note: individuals who entered residential care prior to 1 July 2014 but cease to receive care for more than 28 days (other than because of leave), will be subject to the post-30 June 2014 rules. Also, those same individuals who also move to a new facility on or after 1 July 2014 can elect to be assessed under the post-30 June 2014 rules.
NET MEDICAL EXPENSES TAX OFFSET
The Net Medical Expenses Tax Offset is available in respect of expenses relating to certain payments made to Aged care facilities including daily care fee, income-tested fee, periodic accommodation payments and extra services fees, until 30 June 2019.
For the 2015/2016 financial year, individuals with adjusted taxable income of less than $90,000 are entitled to a tax offset of 20% of their net medical expenses over $2,265. Those with adjusted taxable income of $90,000 or greater are entitled to a tax offset of 10% of their net medical expenses over $5,343.
Furthermore, families with adjusted taxable income of less than $180,000 are entitled to a tax offset of 20% of their net medical expenses over $2,265. Families with adjusted taxable income of $180,000 or greater are entitled to a tax offset of 10% of their net medical expenses over $5,343.
AGED CARE ASSESSMENT OF THE FAMILY HOME
The value of the family home of individuals entering residential care on or after 1 July 2014 will be included as an assessable asset up to the relevant cap ($157,987.20 as of 20 September 2015) for the purposes of calculating the means tested fee, unless there is a 'protected person' residing in the home.
A 'protected person' is defined as the relevant individual's:
spouse or dependent child who is living in the home, or
carer eligible for income support payments who has lived there for two years; or
close relative who is eligible for an income support payment and who has been living there for at least five years.
In the case of married couples, the value of their home will be included when the last member leaves the home to move to a facility.

SALARY PACKAGING
Salary packaging is an arrangement between an employer and an employee for the employee to forgo a part of their salary or wages in exchange for another employer benefit. Such benefits are known as fringe benefits and can include any rights, privileges or services provided by the employer which are not salary or wages. In addition to salary and wages superannuation and certain employee share acquisition schemes are also not considered to be fringe benefits for the purpose of calculating Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT).
In negotiating the salary package it will be necessary to consider any FBT liability that will be borne by your employer. The amount of FBT that your employer will be liable for will depend on the type of benefit and type of organisation, entity or employer providing the benefit.
There are 13 distinct types of fringe benefits which include:
car fringe benefits
debt waiver fringe benefits
loan fringe benefits
expense payment fringe benefits
housing fringe benefit
living away from home allowance fringe benefit
airline transport fringe benefit
board fringe benefits
entertainment
tax exempt body entertainment fringe benefit
car parking fringe benefit
property fringe benefit
residual fringe benefit.
Some of the above types of benefits are excluded from FBT or receive concessional FBT treatment. This can make salary packaging appealing particularly to those on a higher marginal tax rate.
Salary packaging can also be appealing to those employed by specific non profit organisations who are either exempt or receive concessional FBT treatment up to prescribed limits. Such organisations will either receive an FBT exemption or rebate. The three categories of exempt or concessionally treated organisations include:
Charitable institutions – who receive a FBT rebate equal to 49% of the gross FBT payable up to a maximum grossed up threshold of $30,000
Public benevolent institution (PBI) – who receive a FBT exemption up to a grossed up value of $30,000
Public & non-profit hospitals – receive an exemption from FBT up to a grossed up value of $17,000
For the purpose of calculating FBT, benefits are grossed up to reflect the equivalent gross salary that someone on the highest tax rate would have to earn to purchase the benefit with after tax income. Where GST can be claimed by the benefit provider the amount is grossed up further to reflect the GST credit available. In this instance the grossed up rate is 2.0802 compared to 1.8868 where no GST input credit is available.
Fringe benefits are typically included as income for social security purposes so it is necessary to consider any social security implications before implementing a salary sacrifice arrangement.

INSURANCE BOND
An insurance bond is an insurance policy which is suitable for long term savings. Insurance bonds offer a number of investment alternatives, ranging from diversified funds to specific sector funds (such as Australian equities).
Tax on investment earnings and realised capital gains is paid progressively throughout the term of the bond by the bond and not by the investor personally. The internal rate of tax payable by the bond is 30%.
Some of the advantages of investing in an insurance bond are:
a lower rate of tax is paid on the investment earnings and realised capital gains where the investor’s marginal tax rate is higher than 30%. If held to maturity (a period of 10 years), all earnings and realised capital gains are tax free to the owner of the bond;
switching between investment options will not constitute a capital gains tax event and, therefore, capital gains tax arises in the hands of the bond holder. This has significant tax advantages for a high income earner who can realise capital gains arising from being in a market linked investment option; and
bond earnings and realised capital gains are not included in the assessable income of the investor. This helps to reduce the investor’s liability for the Medicare levy and, in some cases, may help retain their entitlement to certain taxable income related rebates (such as the low income rebate) or to qualify for other forms of government financial assistance.
As insurance bond’s are internally taxed,the investor will generally not be required to declare the earnings and capital gains in their personal tax return. However, if the investor makes a full or partial withdrawal before 10 years has elapsed, they will be required to return the relevant proportion of earnings and realised capital gains as taxable income in their tax return (they will also be entitled to claim a tax rebate on these earnings and realised capital gains).
The following table describes the taxation consequences of making early or at maturity redemptions from insurance bonds.
Period	Amount subject to tax	Amount tax free	Rebate amount
Before the
commencement of the 9th year	All earnings and realised capital gains.	Investment sums only.	100% of the tax already paid by the provider.
During the 9th year	2/3 of earnings and realised capital gains.	1/3 of earnings and realised capital gains plus investment sums.	2/3 of the tax already paid by the provider.
During the 10th year	1/3 of earnings and realised capital gains.	2/3 of earnings and realised capital gains plus investment sums.	1/3 of the tax already paid by the provider.
After 10 years	Nil	All earnings and realised capital gains plus investment sum.	Nil
Insurance bonds can be used as part of a regular savings plan strategy. In doing so, however, it will be important to ensure that the tax advantage offered after 10 years is maintained. For this purpose, investors should be aware the contributions added to the investment at any time cannot exceed 125% of the previous year's total contributions, otherwise the 10 year period will reset and commence from the start of the year that the limit was exceeded.

KEY CHANGES FROM 1 JULY 2017
Key changes that may impact your retirement strategy are outlined below:
TRANSFER BALANCE CAP OF $1.6 MILLION
From 1 July 2017, a ‘transfer balance cap’ (TBC) applies limiting the total amount of superannuation that can be transferred from accumulation phase into the tax-free retirement (pension) phase. The TBC for 2017/2018 is $1.6 million. Amounts in excess of the cap must be commuted back to the accumulation phase or withdrawn from superannuation.
REMOVAL OF THE TAX EXEMPTION FOR EARNINGS OF TRANSITION TO RETIREMENT (TTR) INCOME STREAMS
From 1 July 2017, the tax exemption for earnings derived from assets supporting a TTR income stream, will no longer apply. Earnings will be taxed in the same way as funds in accumulation phase, i.e. a maximum rate of 15% (10% on capital gains for assets held more than 12 months).
REDUCTION IN SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION CAPS
Age of member at 1 July of the relevant financial year	Non-concessional contribution cap
	2017/2018
Under 65	$100,000 or $300,000 averaged over 3 years under the bring forward provisions
65 or over	$100,000

Age of member at 30 June of the preceding financial year	Concessional contribution cap
	2017/18
Under 49	$25,000
49 or over	$25,000

REMOVAL OF THE 10% RULE
From 1 July 2017, all individuals under the age of 75 (and eligible to contribute), will be able to claim a tax deduction on  personal contributions without having to meet the 10% rule.
CATCH-UP CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
From 1 July 2018, individuals with total superannuation balances less than $500,000 will be able to access their unused concessional contributions cap on a rolling basis for a period of five years.
ABOLISHING ANTI-DETRIMENT PAYMENTS
Anti-detriment payments will be abolished after 1 July 2017. However, the anti-detriment benefit will still be payable where death occurs prior to 1 July 2017 and the benefit is paid before 1 July 2019.

BENEFITS OF SUPERANNUATION
Superannuation is a tax effective structure to build wealth for retirement. Some of the benefits of superannuation include that:
earnings are taxed at a maximum of 15%. This rate is discounted to 10% on realised capital gains on assets held by the fund for longer than 12 months
salary sacrificed contributions are taxed 15% (up to the concessional contribution cap) compared to an individual’s marginal tax rate
individual’s who are self employed or have left the workforce can receive a tax deduction for contributions in certain circumstances
it can provide a level of asset protection against creditors
it can be drawn as a lump sum or an income stream upon meeting preservation age and/ or satisfying a condition of release
withdrawals are tax free upon turning age 60
personal insurance can be held on behalf of members such as term life insurance, total and permanent disablement and income protection insurances, and
it can be used as an effective estate planning vehicle in some circumstances

PRESERVATION
The key purpose of superannuation savings is to assist in the provision of income in retirement.
There are various generous tax concessions available to encourage superannuation savings, the trade off being that access to the amounts accumulated in superannuation is restricted to ensure that the savings are available in retirement, or upon death or permanent disability. These restrictions are referred to as ‘preservation rules’.
Essentially, the preservation rules provide that an individual’s superannuation savings may only be paid either when they reach their preservation age and/or also meet a 'condition of release'. When this occurs, then the individual’s preserved benefits can be paid to them.
The table below describes the preservation ages for individuals born at various times:
PRESERVATION AGE
Date of birth	Preservation age
Before 1 July 1960	55 years
1 July 1960 – 30 June 1961	56 years
1 July 1961 – 30 June 1962	57 years
1 July 1962 – 30 June 1963	58 years
1 July 1963 – 30 June 1964	59 years
On or after 1 July 1964	60 years
CONDITIONS OF RELEASE
The main conditions of release are:
retirement;
reaching age 65;
death;
attaining preservation age and commencing a non-commutable income stream (also called a transition to retirement income stream);
permanent or temporary incapacity;
terminal medical condition;
severe financial hardship;
compassionate grounds;
termination of gainful employment post attaining age 60;and
permanently departing Australia (temporary residents only).
Upon request, we would be happy to provide you with further information about this subject.
BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS
Although it is prudent to make provision for retirement by contributing to your superannuation savings, access to such contributions will, generally, be restricted until the attainment of a certain age and/or satisfaction of a ‘condition of release’.

ELIGIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE INTO SUPERANNUATION
There are certain rules which must be satisfied before contributions can be accepted by a complying superannuation fund, ie. a superannuation fund that will enjoy tax concessions.
In particular, those rules generally state that:
if you are under age 65, then any contribution can be made into a superannuation fund for your benefit;
if you are between age 65 and 75, then a superannuation fund can accept:
	mandated  employer  contributions  for  your  benefit  (such  as  Superannuation  Guarantee contributions); and
	voluntary employer contributions (such as salary sacrifice) or personal contributions for your benefit, as long as you have been gainfully employed on at least a part time basis during the financial year in which the contributions are made (usually referred to as the ‘Work Test’) and that the contributions are received before the 28th day after the end of the month in which you turn 75; and
	if you are age 75 or more, then only mandated employer contributions can be made for your benefit..
A superannuation fund cannot accept a non-concessional contribution unless you have provided your tax file number. The fund can accept concessional contributions without holding your tax file number, however the fund will be required to withhold tax of 34% on the contribution (in addition to the usual 15% tax levied on the contribution).

NON-CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Non-concessional contributions are contributions not included in the assessable income of the superannuation fund. The most common types of non-concessional contributions include:
personal after tax contributions;
spouse contributions made on an individual’s behalf;
contributions in excess of the members concessional contribution cap where the election to release an amount of that excess has not been made;
transfers from foreign super funds; and
the amount of a personal deductible contribution to the extent that it is not allowable as a deduction to the individual.
Contributions excluded from the definition of non-concessional contributions include:
Government co-contribution
contributions arising from certain personal injury payments, and
contributions within the capital gains tax cap amount (any amount in excess of this cap will be included as a non-concessional contribution).
NON-CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS CAP
A cap applies to the total amount of non-concessional contributions made into superannuation.
The non-concessional contributions caps are:
Age of member at 1 July of relevant financial year	Non-concessional contribution cap
	2017/2018
Under 65	$100,000 or $300,000 averaged over 3 years under the bring forward provisions
65 or over	$100,000

Where an individual makes a non-concessional contribution after their 65th birthday, they will need to satisfy the Work Test, i.e they must have worked at least 40 hours over 30 consecutive days in the relevant financial year.
From 1 July 2017, non-concessional contributions can no longer be made unless an individual has a total superannuation balance less than the general transfer balance cap ($1.6 million for 2017/2018), on 30 June of the preceding financial year.
‘BRING FORWARD’ PROVISIONS
The bring forward provisions allow for up to three times the non-concessional cap to be contributed over the current and following two financial years.
This concession is available to individuals who are age 64 or less as at 1 July in the relevant financial year.
The bring forward provisions are triggered as soon as an individual’s non-concessional contributions in any single financial year exceed the annual non-concessional contributions cap, currently $180,000 ($100,000 from 1 July 2017). Once the bring forward provisions are triggered total non-concessional contributions must not exceed the allowable cap for the current and two subsequent financial years.
TRANSITIONAL RULES
Transitional rules apply where an individual triggered the bring forward provisions in the 2015/2016 or 2016/2017 financial year but did not fully utilise the cap of $540,000 by 30 June 2017.
In these circumstances the cap will be adjusted and reassessed based on the reduced non-concessional contribution cap and the total non-concessional contribution made during the three-year period, i.e. if the bring forward provisions were triggered in the 2015/2016 financial year, the cap would be $460,000. If the provisions are triggered in 2016/2017, the cap would be $380,000.
For example, if an individual made  a non-concessional contribution of $200,000 in the 2016/2017 financial year, their remaining non-concessional cap for the next two financial years would be $180,000. This is illustrated as follows:
Year	Non-concessional contributions amount	Non-concessional contributions cap
2017/2018	$180,000	$100,000
2018/2019		$100,000
Total	$380,000	$380,000
EXCESS NON-CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Where an individual exceeds the non-concessional contributions cap, they can elect to release an amount equal to the excess non-concessional contributions plus 85% of an ‘associated earnings’ amount from their super.
The purpose of ‘associated earnings’ is to approximate the amount earned from the excess non-concessional contributions while they were held in the superannuation fund.
They would then include 100% of the associated earnings amount in their assessable income for the financial year in which the contribution is made, with a 15% tax offset.
Where an election to release this amount is not made, the excess non-concessional contributions will be taxed at 49% (or 47% from 1 July 2017).

CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Concessional contributions are contributions included in the assessable income of the superannuation fund, and taxed up to 15%. However, individuals with income over $300,000 ($250,000 from 1 July 2017) will be subject to an additional 15% tax on their concessional contributions.
Concessional contributions include:
Employer contributions, e.g. Super Guarantee, salary sacrifice, and notional contributions for defined benefit funds
Personal contributions for which a tax deduction is claimed
The taxable component of a directed termination payment in excess of $1 million, and
Certain allocations from a super fund’s reserve (applicable to SMSF’s & Small APRA funds).
Contributions excluded from the definition of concessional contributions include:
contributions made to a constitutionally protected fund pre-1 July 2017, and
the assessable amount of transfers from foreign super funds.
CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS CAP
A cap applies to the total amount of concessional contributions made by you, or on your behalf, into superannuation.
The concessional contribution caps for the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 financial years are as follows:
Age of member at 30 June of preceding financial year	Concessional contribution cap
	2017/2018
Under 49	$25,000
49 and over	$25,000
From 1 July 2017, the cap is indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) in $2,500 increments.
EXCESS CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Concessional contributions exceeding an individual’s concessional contributions cap are automatically included in that individual’s assessable income for the financial year in which the contribution was made and taxed at their marginal rate.
In addition, an ‘excess concessional contribution charge’ will apply. The purpose of the charge is to recognise that the additional amount of tax due to the excess concessional contributions is collected later than the individual’s tax on other income. Persons who are liable for this charge may pay it personally or out of their superannuation savings.
Excess concessional contributions also count towards an individual’s non-concessional cap unless an election has been made to release an amount of their excess concessional contributions.
CATCH-UP CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
From 1 July 2018, if your Total Superannuation Balance is less than $500,000, you will be able to carry-forward your unused concessional contribution cap amounts over rolling five year periods.
This provides an opportunity for individuals who have been unable to fully utilise their concessional contribution caps, to carry their unused concessional caps forward into years of higher income and provide a larger tax deduction. These ‘catch-up contributions’ will help boost your retirement savings and reduce your potential tax liability.
For example, if in the 2018/19 financial year, your total concessional contributions were $10,000, you could carry forward $15,000 to the next year, which would allow you to make concessional contributions of $40,000 in the 2019/2020 financial year.

TRANSFERRING CASH/ASSETS INTO SUPERANNUATION AND MAKING PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
An individual will be eligible to claim a tax deduction for a personal contribution they make to a complying superannuation fund if:
they are eligible to make contributions to super, and
the contribution is made for the purpose of providing superannuation benefits for themselves, and
they satisfy the age related conditions, and
the individual gives a written notice of their intention to claim the tax deduction to the trustee of the superannuation fund, and the trustee must have given an acknowledgement of receipt of the notice, and
the contribution is made on or before the 28th day after the end of the month in which they turn age 75, and
for contributions made pre-1 July 2017, they satisfy the ‘maximum earnings as employee’ condition (if applicable).
WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM EARNINGS AS EMPLOYEE CONDITION?
The ‘maximum earnings as employee’ condition only applies where:
the contribution is made pre-1 July 2017
in the relevant financial year, you engage in employment activities that would result in you being treated as an employee for the purposes of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth), and
your income attributable to those employment activities is less than 10% of your total assessable income plus reportable fringe benefits and reportable employer superannuation contributions.
IF THE CONTRIBUTION IS MADE BY IN SPECIE TRANSFER OF ASSETS:
Transferring assets into superannuation may trigger capital gains tax, stamp duty and other transaction costs
Only certain assets can be transferred in specie to a superannuation fund, some of which include listed securities, business real property (ie. property used wholly and exclusively in a business) and units in widely held trusts.

TRANSFERRING CASH/ASSETS INTO SUPERANNUATION AND MAKING SALARY SACRIFICE CONTRIBUTIONS
An effective strategy for the accumulation of wealth in the superannuation environment involves individuals’ salary sacrificing amounts of their pre-tax income into their superannuation accounts.
This means that the income sacrificed into superannuation is taxed at 15% rather than an individual’s marginal tax rate, which could be as high as <<49%/47%>>.
Implementing this strategy requires that:
there be a written agreement between the employee and their employer, which clearly documents all the terms of the salary sacrifice arrangement, e.g. an employment agreement;
the arrangement must be prospective, i.e. in place before the individual actually earns the entitlement; and
there must be no access to the sacrificed salary, i.e. it must be permanently foregone.

ACCOUNT BASED PENSION
WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS?

A standard account based pension (ABP) is a flexible form of investment which gives you a regular income and tax advantages. An ABP has the following characteristics:
Regular income stream (paid at least annually).
The minimum annual amount of income you will receive each year is based on your age and account balance (see below for details).
Capital withdrawals can be made at any time.
On the death of the pensioner, the pension can only revert to their spouse, minor child, interdependents and financial dependents, or cashed as a lump-sum to the pensioner's estate.
MINIMUM ANNUAL PENSION PAYMENTS
The below table summaries the minimum income drawdowns:
AGE AT 1 JULY 2017	PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNT BALANCE
Under 65	4.0%
65 – 74	5.0%
75 – 79	6.0%
80 – 84	7.0%
85 – 89	9.0%
90 – 94	11.0%
95 or more	14.0%


It is important to note that ABPs will only provide income until the balance of your superannuation interest is exhausted – that is, it may not provide an income for the rest of your life. We would also like to highlight that you bear the investment performance risk when you employ ABPs, ie. there are no guaranteed returns as there may be with some other types of superannuation products.
TAXATION OF PENSION PAYMENTS
Two major benefits of ABPs are that no tax is payable on the pension payments you receive if you are age 60 or over, and that the capital used to purchase the pension will be invested in a tax free environment, ie. earnings and capital gains derived from the use of that capital will not be subject to taxation.
CAN YOU ACCESS THE FUNDS INVESTED INTO YOUR ABP?
On commencing an ABP (other than a transition to retirement pension), you retain unlimited access to the balance of your superannuation interest and may withdraw part or all of it as a lump sum payment at any time. If you withdraw (commute) your entire balance part way through the financial year, you may be required to have part of your benefit taken as income, in the form of a pension payment.

SOCIAL SECURITY TREATMENT OF YOUR PENSION
The balance of an account based pension is an assessable asset when determining eligibility for income support under the social security assets test.
The income-test assessment of an account based pension held by social security income support recipients immediately prior to 1 January 2015 is a function of the annual actual pension payment less the 'deductible amount'. The 'deductible amount is calculated as:
= pension purchase price - commutations relevant number
Where 'relevant number' is the longest life expectancy of the pension-owner or reversionary beneficiary, at date of commencement.
The above income-test assessment of account-based pensions also applies to reversionary pensions where:
The original pension commenced prior to 1 January 2015, and
The pensioner was in receipt of income support immediately before 1 January 2015 and continued to receive income support until death, and
At the time the pension reverts, the reversionary beneficiary is in receipt of income support, and
Since reversion, the reversionary beneficiary continuously receives income support.
Account based pensions commenced from 1 January 2015 (or held by someone who was not a social security income support recipient immediately prior to 1 January 2015), will be deemed for social security income-test assessment purposes.

SUPERANNUATION DISABILITY PENSION
For individuals who satisfy the permanent incapacity condition of release, establishing an account based pension with their accumulated benefits can be a tax effective means of meeting their income needs.
Where the tax free component constitutes 100% of the total purchase price at commencement, all pension payments and any lump sum withdrawals made will be tax free.
Where the pension includes both a taxable and tax free component, the pension payments will include an amount of each component based on their respective proportions at the commencement of the pension. The tax free component will be received tax-free and the taxable component will be included in the assessable income of the recipient. However, because the pension is a disability pension, the recipient is entitled to receive a 15% tax offset on the taxable proportion of their receipts.
Any investment earnings on the pension will be applied to the tax free and taxable component according to their respective proportions at the commencement of the pension.
Any lump sum withdrawals that include a taxable component will be taxed at a maximum rate of 24% while under preservation age (including 2% Medicare levy and 2% Temporary Budget Repair Levy). If the amount of the withdrawal included in assessable income does not cause taxable income to exceed $37,000 per annum the amount will be taxed at only 17%. If after the pension payment taxable income remains below $6,000 per annum then the pension will be tax free.
Other factors to consider with regard to account based pensions include:
•	You receive a flexible income stream that enables you to choose the amount of income you receive (within statutory limits) and how regularly you wish to receive it. Monthly, quarterly, half yearly and annual payment options are generally available.
•	Any investment earnings and capital gains on assets sold are tax free.
•	You are able to access your capital funds at any time, which means you can make withdrawals in addition to your income payments.
•	They are designed to be extinguished over your life expectancy, meaning that the account balance can be expected to reduce over time (although sound performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio may alleviate this).
•	Drawing above the minimum pension amount may mean that your funds decrease at an increasing rate over time.
•	Your investment will be countered under the social security income and assets tests, which may adversely impact your eligibility for any applicable pension or allowance benefits.
•	If, upon death, the account balance is paid to any of your dependant, such as a spouse or a child under
•	18 years of age, the lump-sum will usually be paid tax free. Conversely, lump-sum tax may be levied on any remaining balance on death (e.g. if paid as a lump-sum to a non-financially dependant beneficiary, such as an adult child).
•	Your investment returns will fluctuate depending on economic and market conditions, which means your investment can increase or decrease in value.

TRANSITION TO RETIREMENT
WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS?
A transition to retirement (TTR) pension has the following characteristics:
regular income stream (paid at least annually)
a minimum annual amount of pension  must be paid each financial income year (except in the first year if the pension commenced in June) equal to the relevant account balance multiplied by an age-based percentage factor. A pro rata minimum payment applies where the pension commences after 1 July, and
the maximum annual amount of pension you may receive each year is 10% of the account balance, and
lump sum withdrawals are not permitted.
It is important to note that TTR pensions will only provide income until the balance of your superannuation interest is exhausted – that is, it may not provide an income for the rest of your life.
From 1 July 2017, the tax exemption for earnings derived from assets supporting a TTR pension will no longer apply. Earnings will be taxed in the same way as funds in the accumulation phase, i.e. a maximum rate of 15% on earnings (10% on capital gains for assets held more than 12 months).
We would also like to highlight that you bear the investment performance risk when you employ a TTR pension, i.e. there are no guaranteed returns as there may be with some other types of superannuation products. There is no limit to the amount that can used to commence a TTR pension.

DEEMING
Applicants for and recipients of various means tested social security payments, such as the Age Pension, will have their entitlements calculated by reference to their income from other sources, including from investments - the Income Test.
The social security deeming rules assume that certain financial investments are earning a certain rate of income, regardless of the rate they may actually earn. These deeming rates can and do change over time.
Financial assets include the following:
Bank, building society and credit union accounts
Term deposits and debentures
Friendly society bonds
Managed investments
Listed shares and securities
Shares in unlisted public companies
Gold and other bullion
Account based income streams commencing from 1 January 2015, or account based income streams commencing prior to this date where the owner was not the receipt of Centrelink income benefits support before 1 January 2015
Certain income streams (eg. income streams with a term less than 5 years)
Approved deposit funds, deferred annuities and superannuation fund investments held by people over Age Pension age
Loans, including those to family trusts and companies, and
Gifts of money or other assets of more than $10,000 in a financial year, or more than $30,000 over five financial years

AGE PENSION ENTITLEMENT
The Age Pension is a government support payment which assists Australian residents to achieve an adequate level of income when they reach Age Pension age. The amount payable takes into account, home ownership, marital status as well as the Income and Assets tests.
To qualify for the Age Pension the following requirements must be met:
You must be of Age Pension age.
You must satisfy Australian residency criteria.
Your income and assets are tested against threshold limits. Under the income and assets tests, an individuals or couple’s (combined) income and assets from all sources are used and applied against the income and asset test formulas to determine a rate of payment.
The test that applies for determining a rate of payment is the one that results in the lowest amount of benefit.

COMMONWEALTH SENIORS HEALTH CARD
Self funded retirees not receiving a Centrelink (or DVA) income support payment who have reached Age Pension age may be entitled to a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card. This can assist in helping to reduce the cost of prescription medicines and certain other expenses.
Other conditions for qualification for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card include that the applicant must:
be an Australian resident, living in Australia; and
if you are a recently arrived resident have met the newly arrived residents waiting period and
have reached Age Pension age and
not be receiving a social security pension or benefit, a Department of Veteran’s Affairs service pension or an income support supplement and
have provided Centrelink with your tax file number and your partners tax file number or otherwise have been granted an exemption and
have an annual adjusted taxable income of:
-	less than $52,796 (singles);
-	$84,472 (couples combined); or
-	$105,592 (couples combined who are separated due to ill health).
For these purposes, adjusted taxable income is taxable income (eg. interest and earnings), a deemed amount from any account based income streams, foreign income not subject to Australian income tax, total net investment losses (eg. from rental property or from financial investments), employer provided benefits in excess of $1,000 (eg. cars, school fees, loans, housing and health insurance, and reportable superannuation contributions (generally, discretionary or voluntary contributions).
From 1 January 2015 account based pension income will be included in the income test for the first time. A deemed amount will be included in an individual's adjusted taxable income when assessing their eligibility. Grandfathering applies where the account based pension was established prior to 1 January 2015 and the individual held a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card before this date. These changes will affect the following individuals:
New Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card holders from 1 January 2015, or
Existing care holders who commence a new account based pension on or after 1 January 2015.
The holder of a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card will obtain a discount on their expenditure on prescription medicines though the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). By producing their card to their pharmacist, cardholders will generally only pay a small amount for each PBS medicine.
The holder of a Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card may also be entitled to receive the Seniors Supplement. This is a non taxable payment which is made every three months to assist with regular bills for example rates and utilities.

FUNERAL BONDS
Funeral bonds are investments used to accumulate funds to help pay for future funeral expenses. This helps to provide you with more certainty that money will be available upon your death to help pay for your funeral expenses.
The money invested plus the interest or bonuses received by the bond cannot be surrendered or accessed until the policy holder’s death, at which time the bond matures.
The money received at maturity is then able to be used to pay for funeral expenses. Proof of funeral costs may be required, and any unused investment value may be retained by the bond provider.
SOCIAL SECURITY TREATMENT
Funeral bonds are classed as exempt funeral investments for social security purposes. This means that if they meet certain rules, the value of the bond is exempt from the Centrelink Income and Asset Tests. As a result, funeral bonds can potentially increase the amount of Centrelink benefits you receive.
For a funeral bond to be exempt from Centrelink means testing, the initial amount invested cannot exceed the funeral bond threshold (currently $12,250 as at July 2015). However, where the bond is purchased jointly then the entire amount must not exceed $12,250. If more than the funeral bond threshold is initially invested, the bond is fully assessed by Centrelink as a financial investment.

SERVICE PENSION
Service pension is an income support payment that provides a regular income for people with limited means. A service pension can be paid to eligible veterans on the grounds of age or invalidity, and to eligible partners, former partners, widows and widowers. It is subject to income and assets tests.
The age service pension and partner service pension is paid 5 years earlier than the Age Pension paid by Centrelink, recognising that intangible effects of war may result in premature ageing of the veteran and/or loss of earning power.
If you are a male veteran you must have reached 60 years. If you are a female veteran see the table below to work out how old you must be before you can claim age service pension.

BORN	WOMEN ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICE AGE PENSION AT AGE
Before 1 July 1954	Eligible
From 1 July 1954	60
Payment is subject to both an assets and income test, and the test yielding the lower payment rate will apply.

The Widow Allowance (WA) is available to eligible recipients who were born on or before 1 July 1955 and who have become widowed, divorced or separated since turning 40, and who have no recent workforce participation. That is, employment of at least 20 hours per week for 13 weeks or more during the last 12 months. In order to remain eligible for WA, a participation interview must be attended annually.
To receive WA, you must generally be an Australian resident, or have 10 years of qualifying Australian residency. The WA is payable for up to 6 weeks of a temporary absence from Australia (or longer if the recipient has to travel to continue their studying or training as part of their full-time Australian course or apprenticeship).
Whilst receiving the WA, the following other benefits may also be available:

WHAT IS A WILL?
A Will is a legal document that nominates the beneficiaries of your estate assets in the event of death. It also nominates the person who you wish to be responsible for overseeing the distribution of these assets (executor).
The legislation governing Wills and intestacy is state and territory base. This means that there are differences between each state and territory regarding the treatment of Wills, administration and intestacy. It is important to consult with your legal adviser in your state when preparing your estate plan and Will.
SHOULD I MAKE A WILL?
Everyone should have a Will. If you do not make a Will, your estate will be distributed by a court appointed administrator using a fixed formula determined by legislation. This formula will apply regardless of your situation. However, if you make a Will:
•	You can decide on how to divide your estate.
•	You can appoint who you wish to administer your estate.
•	You can indicate your preference as to a testamentary guardian for your children.
WHAT DOES YOUR WILL COVER?

Your Will does not transfer ownership of all of your assets in the event of your death. Those assets that are covered by your Will are known as estate assets and those assets that are not covered by your Will are known as non-estate assets.
Estate assets are:
•	Assets owned in your name
Non estate assets are:
•	Jointly owned assets
•	Assets owned by trusts
•	Assets owned by companies
Assets that can be either estate or non-estate assets are:
•	Life insurance
•	Superannuation (including superannuation pensions)
Generally, the formal requirements of a Will are as follows:
•	The Will must be in writing
•	The Will maker must be over 18 years of age and of sound mind
•	The Will must be signed by the will maker (testator)
•	The Will must have the appearance that the testator intended by their signature to give effect to the Will
•	The signature and initials must be witnessed by at least two people with the Will maker present at the time the Will maker signs or acknowledges the Will.
Procedures that should be followed in order to avoid problems are:
•	The witnesses should not be beneficiaries or spouses of the beneficiaries of the Will
•	The Will maker and witnesses should all use the same pen as evidence that they were all together when the Will was signed
•	The Will should be dated before it is signed
•	Any alterations should be initialled by the Will maker and witnesses
•	Copies of the Will should be made and marked “Copy, original kept at”.
PREPARING A WILL
When preparing a Will, the following areas need to be considered:
•	Who your beneficiaries are
•	Who your executor(s) will be
•	Who will look after your children (they need a guardian if they are under 18 or not able to care for themselves)
•	Whether you want to leave anyone out of your Will and the reasons why
•	What your funeral arrangements are
•	What happens if your beneficiaries die before you do
•	What are your assets
•	Specific bequests and devises
•	Establishing provisions for testamentary trusts and incorporating the terms of a testamentary trust within your Will
•	Powers of appointment you may hold individually or with another or others.
WHAT CAN CAUSE A WILL TO BE OUT-OF-DATE?
•	If you marry after you have made a Will and the Will was not executed in contemplation of marriage then the Will becomes invalid at the date of the marriage.
•	Divorce automatically invalidates some (but not all) of those clauses in a Will that refer to the former spouse.
•	Has your relationship with your spouse changed?
•	Has anyone named in your will died or changed their name?
•	Are you still happy with the people that you have appointed as executor or as testamentary guardian of your minor children?
•	Do you want to change your beneficiaries?
•	Has your financial position changed?
•	Does the Will provide adequately for asset protection and tax effectiveness?
•	Are the terms of your Will coordinated with your other estate planning decisions eg superannuation beneficiary nominations?
GIFTS IN WILLS
The term gifts can be categorised as follows:
•	A gift of real property (land, buildings) is called a devise
•	A gift of personal property (money, shares books, furniture) is called a legacy or bequest
A devise can be either:
•	A specific devise (eg my house at No 1 Apple Street)
•	Residuary devise (eg what is left in the estate after all other obligations for payment of debts and specific gifts off all kinds have been met)
•	Legacies or bequests can be either:
•	A specific gift or usually referred to as a bequest (eg the green vase and the table it stands on in the hall)
•	A general gift or a bequest (all my shares)
•	A pecuniary legacy (and I leave $5,000 to my granddaughter)
•	A demonstrative gift (eg $5,000 from my ABC bank account)
•	A residuary legacy or bequest (and I leave the residue of my personal property to my daughter)
The classifications are important legally. As assets can be sold, given away, or stolen before the Will maker dies or there may be insufficient assets in an estate to satisfy all the gifts made in a Will. In the case where an asset is no longer, part of the estate and it was a specific gift, the gift will fail.
Where there are insufficient funds in the estate to satisfy all the gifts, there is a rule that specific gifts in a Will must be satisfied before general gifts. If there is then insufficient in the estate to satisfy any or all general gifts, these gifts will fail.
LIFE TENANTS
The testator in a Will provides benefits for the life of another person (called the life tenant). For example, if the asset is a house, then the life tenant may be given the right to live there until he or she dies. Alternatively, the life tenant could have the right to any income the property may generate if rented.
REMAINDERMAN
A person who shares in estate assets after an individual with a life interest has died.
EXECUTORS
An executor is a person(s) or a corporate trustee who you nominate in your Will to carry out of your arrangements after your death. Their duties include:
•	Locating the Will
•	Notifying the beneficiaries
•	Looks after the estate (ensure that assets are safe and insurance protection is arranged)
•	Values the estate (must list all the assets and liabilities for the purposes of applying for a grant or probate)
•	Obtain an authority to administer the estate (apply for Grant of Probate to administer the estate)
•	Complete income tax returns (before any estate can be finally distributed it is necessary to obtain a clearance from the Australian Taxation Office)
•	Pay all debts (including funeral and burial expenses)
•	Divide the estate and pay or transfer gifts to the nominated beneficiaries (or in the case of an intestacy or partial intestacy) distribute the estate assets in accordance with the statutory scheme of intestacy applicable.
•	Establish trusts (required if any beneficiary is under 18 years of age or mentally incapable or where there are specific instructions in the Will. Such trusts often need ongoing administration over many years)
Risks associated with being appointed an executor:
•	the estate and administration needs to start and be completed in a reasonable amount of time (if you fail to do this and the beneficiaries experience financial loss, you could be personally liable for the loss).
•	you need to protect the estate assets (you could be personally liable for any damage to property that has not been appropriately secured or insured)
•	if you make incorrect payments or incorrect distributions occur, you may be personally liable to make good
•	you will need to ensure that you have properly attended to the payment of all creditor accounts, including any taxation liabilities. As executor you are personally liable to make these payments
•	managing a trust can be onerous task and requires permanency and sound financial management skills
A role of an executor is a demanding one. It requires a good understanding of legal, accounting and taxation requirements. Many people appoint a relative or a close friend or appoint a corporate trustee.

SPECIFIC ESTATE WISHES
TRUSTS
WHAT IS A TRUST?

A trust involves assets managed by a trustee. The trustee can be an individual, a group of individuals or even a Trustee company. The main responsibility of the trustee is to look after the assets in accordance with the terms of the trust. These terms are set out in a trust deed. The trust deed sets the ground for the operation of the trust. It identifies the trust assets and those who may be entitled to benefits from the trust.
If the trust provisions are contained in your will, you are the testator and those who benefit from a trust are known as beneficiaries.
WHAT SORT OF TRUST FITS YOUR NEEDS?

Testamentary Trusts are created by a Will. A testamentary trust allows you (testator) to specify how the assets will be managed for your nominated beneficiaries after you pass away. A testamentary trust specifies how your assets and any income likely to be generated from these assets are distributed after your death.
Minor’s Trusts are created to protect and maintain assets until a child who is to inherit, reaches 18 (or any age the testator specifies). One of the main reasons for setting up this type of trust is to finance a child’s education.
Life Tenancy Trusts can be created as a specific type of testamentary trust under which the testator in will provides benefits for the life of another person (called life tenant). The beneficiary, however, has no claim to ownership whilst the life tenant is alive.
Inter Vivos Trusts allow to people to establish a trust that comes into effect while they are still alive. Parents or grandparents, for example can in their lifetime, set up an Inter Vivos Trust to provide ongoing support for a disabled family member or even to pay their grandchildren’s future school fess.
Superannuation Minor’s Trusts are established following the death of a member of a superannuation fund if the fund’s Trustee identifies a child or number of children as the beneficiary/beneficiaries.
Retiring Trustee arrangement can sometimes be needed when a trustee of an existing trust is not able to continue to act as trustee. This may be due to age, loss of capacity, change of location, increased responsibilities or conflict.
WHY CREATE A TRUST IN YOUR WILL?
By creating a trust in your will, you are planning for the future use and management of your assets after your death for your nominated beneficiaries.
INDIVIDUAL OR CORPORATE TRUSTEE AND CO TRUSTEE
A trustee can be individuals or be a corporate trustee or two trustees jointly. Assets are owned by a trustee on trust for a discretionary trust, are held for the benefit of all the potential beneficiaries. A trust usually has a life of 80 years so they will often survive the person who originally arranged to set them up. Therefore it is important to consider who controls the trust otherwise the wealth in the trust may end up with those you do not intend.
CONTROL OF THE TRUST
There are usually two levels of control:
•	the trustee, who administers the trust and exercises discretion year by year as to whom income/capital is paid to
•	the Appointer, who has the power to hire and fire the trustee.
CONTROL AT TRUSTEE LEVEL
If you are a personal trustee, you will need to consider:
•	what the trust deed says about a change of trustee
•	death or incapacity of a trustee
If the trustee is a corporate trustee:
•	who are the shareholders? whom will these shares pass to under your will?
•	what does the constitution say about appointment of directors?, the power to hire and fire directors
CONTROL AT APPOINTER LEVEL
Assessing the succession of control at this level is even more critical, you will need to consider:
•	check what the trust deed
•	is there provision in the trust deed for the next appointer
•	the appointer will need to appoint their successor
There is no 'right' answer. Whom you choose or which combination you choose will depend on the nature of the task (i.e. simple or complex) and whom you have to choose from. Whoever is chosen should be aware of their responsibility and the fact that some estates can take a number of years to administer.
If you choose a family member or friend who is not skilled in this area, they must appreciate their need to seek and rely upon professional advice.
HOW DO I CHOOSE A TRUSTEE?
The trustee chosen must be someone you regard as being honest, reliable and trustworthy. They must have the right skills and experience to manage assets efficiently and in accordance with the trust deed or Will
and relevant laws. There is also the question of longevity, ideally the trustee will keep administering and managing the trust for as long as it remains in operation.
WHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A TRUSTEE?
The trustee has key responsibilities when governing the management and administration of trusts. These responsibilities are a statutory code of conduct. They are required to:
•	be acquainted with the purpose and terms of the trust
•	identify the trust’s assets and manage them in the best interest of all beneficiaries
•	protect the trust assets at all times
•	exercise care, diligence and skill that a prudent person would exercise in managing the affairs of other persons
•	comply with all accounting, reporting and auditing requirements
•	keep in touch with beneficiaries and meet their needs
•	comply with Trust law and or terms of the deed
A professional Trustee company has even more stringent requirements under the law for providing a responsible, quality, professional administration than is required of an individual. A professional Trustee company is subject to regular internal and external audit processes whilst an individual is not.
Some important things to remember:
•	a trust deed cannot easily be changed, it is important that you work with the right people to get it right the first time
•	once you have transferred assets into a trust, you no longer own them
•	make sure you choose the beneficiaries carefully
•	make sure trustees are aware of their responsibilities, they can be sued if any of their decisions are negligent or fraudulent.
SELF MANAGED SUPERANNUATION FUND AND ESTATE PLANNING
Superannuation is not an estate asset and the person who may receive the benefits upon your death may not be the person you intended. Superannuation is a form of a trust and as a result, the destination of your superannuation will be determined in accordance with the trust deed, superannuation laws and possibly the discretion of the trustee. That is, the trustees are not compelled to act in accordance with the Will.
There are a number of ways to have your say who your benefits go to:
•	nominating a preferred beneficiary, this will act as a guide for the trustee however the trustee is not obliged to pay
•	binding nomination, instructs the trustee who your death benefit is paid to, the trustee is bound by your instructions
•	if you do not nominate any beneficiaries, the trustee will consider information provided by your dependants, the legal personal representative or your estate and other relevant parties to determine who your benefits will go to
•	reversionary beneficiary (for pensions), you must nominate a dependant
WHO CAN RECEIVE A DEATH BENEFIT?
SIS legislation limits beneficiaries for superannuation death benefits to:
•	dependant’s as defined under SIS or
•	the member’s legal personal representative (which is usually the executor of the estate)
If no one falls into these two categories, the beneficiary may be anyone nominated by the trustee. For SIS purposes, a dependant includes:
•	a spouse;
•	any child of the member who is under 18 years of age (includes an adopted child, step child or an ex nuptial child);
•	a financial dependant;
•	any person with whom the member has an interdependency relationship.
HOW CAN A DEATH BENEFIT BE PAID?
Subject to the terms of the trust deed, a death benefit can be paid as a lump sum, income stream or combination of both.
The death benefit when paid is paid to the individual as either a tax dependant or non-tax dependants. Tax treatment of death benefits paid to tax dependants
•	If a lump sum death benefit is paid to a tax dependant, the benefit is tax free.
•	A superannuation pension death benefit (taxed element) is tax free if either the deceased or recipient is over the age of 60. The untaxed element of a superannuation pension death benefit is subject to marginal tax rates less a 10% rebate if either the deceased or recipient is over age 60.
•	All other superannuation pension death benefits are taxed at marginal rates and receive a 15% offset (element taxed in the fund) or no offset (element untaxed in the fund).
Taxation treatment of death benefits paid to non-tax dependants
•	Non-tax dependants can only receive death benefits as a lump sum.
•	If the lump sum benefit is tax at 16.5% (element taxed) and at 31.5% (element untaxed).
DEATH BENEFITS PAID TO THE ESTATE
The trustee pays tax on the death benefit in the same way it would have been taxed if the payment were made directly to you.
LONG TERM ESTATE PLANNING
Estate planning is a process designed to help protect your total wealth so that the wealth distribution is according to your wishes. More than just a Will, an estate plan also takes into account your superannuation, life insurances, guardian and powers of attorney as well as assets held solely in your name or jointly with others, or assets held in private companies or trusts. It is a way of ensuring that your estate passes onto your beneficiaries in the most financially efficient and tax effective way possible upon death or incapacity.

SUPERANNUATION DEATH BENEFITS – DEATH BENEFIT NOMINATIONS
WHAT HAPPENS WITH MY SUPER IN THE EVENT OF DEATH?

Your superannuation is not an asset that is distributable through your Will upon your death. Accordingly, your superannuation will be paid to one or more of your dependants or to your legal personal representative (ie your estate). You generally have a choice of two options.
1.	Trustee discretion - You can provide a non-binding nomination which gives the trustee direction as to whom you wish your benefit to be paid, although ultimately the decision is at the discretion of the trustee.
Whilst exercising this discretion, the trustee of the fund must consider all potential claimants. They do this by taking into account a member's personal wishes such as their Will, or any other evidence that may be relevant when making their decision. If no dependants can be found, the benefit will generally be paid to the deceased’s estate subject to the governing rules of the fund.
On the other hand, a binding nomination instructs the trustee to whom they must pay your benefit.
2.	Binding death benefit nomination - A superannuation fund can accept a binding death benefit nomination from a member to choose who they want their account paid to in the event of their death. The nomination provides greater certainty of outcome to the member and it relieves the trustee from deciding who is entitled to a payment.
This type of nomination is most relevant where the member is concerned that someone may challenge the trustee’s discretion or the trustee may not follow their nomination (eg the member is in a second marriage or wishes to ensure that the trustee does not pay a death benefit to an estranged spouse or child).
It is important to note that while the trustee is obliged to honour a binding death nomination this declaration can potentially be overridden by State based legislation (such as the Family Provision Act).
A binding death benefit nomination is only effective for a maximum of three years (non SMSFs) and to be a valid nomination, it must be:
Made in writing
Witnessed by two adult witnesses who are not beneficiaries
As part of your regular estate planning, it is prudent to update your binding death benefit nominations at least every 3 years depending on changes in your circumstances.
WHO CAN RECEIVE THE SUPER BENEFIT?
A dependant for superannuation purposes can receive your super death benefit. This includes the following individuals:
Spouse (legal or de facto spouse)
Child, adopted child, step child, ex nuptial child of any age
A person who is financially dependent on you
A person with whom you have an ‘interdependency relationship’
WHAT TAX IS PAYABLE ON THE SUPER BENEFIT?
Superannuation death benefit payments are tax free if paid to a dependant for tax purposes. This includes the following individuals:
Spouse (legal or de facto spouse)
Child, adopted child, step child, ex nuptial child under the age of 18
A person who is financially dependent on you at the date of death
A person with whom you have an ‘interdependency relationship’
Any individual who receives a super lump sum as a result of the deceased person (as defined in 302-195 (2)) dying in the line of duty
Dependants for tax purposes have two options when receiving the death benefit:
1. Take a lump sum – this benefit is received tax free
2. Receive the benefit a pension. There are two main taxation outcomes.
A death benefit (taxed element) paid as pension will be tax free if the primary or reversionary beneficiary is aged 60 or over. If both are under age 60 at the time of death, the pension (less any tax free amount) will continue to be taxed at the reversionary beneficiary’s marginal tax rate (less 15% pension tax offset) until the reversionary beneficiary turns age 60 (when it becomes tax free).
If the death benefit is paid as a pension to a dependant child, the balance must be paid as a tax free lump sum when the child turns 25 (unless permanently disabled).
Individuals considered non tax dependants (generally adult children) are forced to receive a lump sum payment. In this case, the taxable component (taxed element) of the super benefit is generally taxed at 15% (plus Medicare levy). Any tax free component of the super benefit is received tax free.
It is essential that any estate planning strategies with your superannuation must be implemented by highly qualified professional advisers to maximise the value of your estate.
HOW  IS  THE  LIFE  INSURANCE  COMPONENT  OF  A  SUPER  DEATH BENEFIT TREATED?
Where a death benefit superannuation lump sum arising from a life insurance policy is paid to a dependant of the deceased member, the total benefit is tax free – it is not assessable income or exempt income in the hands of the dependant.
However, where the benefit is paid to a non dependant (for example, a non dependant child of the deceased)
the payment will be taxable. Subject to a formula for defining the underlying components of this benefit, part of the payment will be treated as a taxed element and the remainder as an untaxed element. The tax treatment of these components is as follows:
Taxed element – 15% (plus Medicare levy)
Untaxed element – 30% (plus Medicare levy)
As the taxation potential for super insurance death benefits paid to a non dependant is even greater than that levied by ordinary super death benefits, it is important to consider the dependency status of a beneficiary when nominating them.

CHILD ACCOUNT BASED PENSION
Superannuation death benefits are often paid to children under age 18 to assist in supporting the child after the death of a parent.
The tax treatment is the same as it would be for any other tax dependant (such as the spouse), which is:
if the deceased was age 60 or over at date of death, the pension to the child will be tax-free
if the deceased was under age 60 at date of death, pension payments receive the 15% pension offset and the child is taxed at the normal adult marginal tax rates.
If the pension is paid to a child under age 18 then it must be commuted when the child turns 25 (unless the child meets disability criteria). The commuted benefit is neither assessable nor exempt income if it is a death benefits pension and:
the child is under age 25, or
the commutation is because the child is turning age 25, or
the child is disabled.

SPECIAL DISABILITY TRUSTS
A Special Disability Trust (SDT) is a trust, usually established for succession planning by parents and immediate family members solely to provide for the future care and accommodation needs of a person with a severe disability.
ADVANTAGES OF A SDT
Benefits of a SDT include:
Asset protection as the assets within the SDT are not beneficially owned by the beneficiary;
The assets of a SDT up to <<$609,500>> (indexed annually and current as at 1 July 2013) are not included in the assets of the principal beneficiary of the trust (i.e. the person with the disability) for the purposes of the assets test when assessing eligibility for Social Security payments;
Income from the assets of a SDT is not counted for the income test for the person with the disability;
The SDT can have a well-respected and professional trust company such as Perpetual to act as its trustee;
Improved ability to plan for the long term welfare and maintenance of the beneficiary;
Prudent management of the trust assets to provide regular income and capital appreciation;
Eligible family members may gift a combined total of $500,000 without implicating Centrelink gifting rules;
Ability for parents to incorporate the trust into their financial wealth accumulation, retirement and estate planning strategy; and
Subject to certain limits, gifts made into the SDT from immediate family members are not subject to the social security deprivation rules.
FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN ESTABLISHING A SDT
Once funds have been contributed to the SDT, they cannot be moved out of the trust other than to pay for the ‘reasonable care and accommodation’ expenses of the principal beneficiary;
The definition for expenses incurred for the ‘reasonable care and accommodation’ may exclude expenses incurred for things such as holidays, a TV, CD player, or ordinary furniture, as these items may not be considered necessary based on the disability;
The SDT cannot pay family members for providing care and maintenance services;
Currently there are limited income tax concessions for a SDT e.g. no Capital Gains Tax concessions;
Amendments generally cannot be made to the trust deed, once it has been established;
There are fees for setting up and maintaining the SDT, such as accounting fees, investment advice fees, ongoing management fees and professional adviser fees; and
Amounts invested above <<$609,500 (as at 1 July 2013)>> will be assessable by Centrelink under the income and assets test.
Centrelink gifting provisions may apply to eligible family members who contribute more than $500,000 to the SDT.
WHAT IS REASONABLE CARE AND ACCOMMODATION?
To ensure the sole beneficiary’s reasonable care and accommodation is met, this will be assessed by the trustee at least every six months by consulting with the immediate care giver. When determining this, the trustee must exclude any daily living costs or expenses that do not relate to this sole purpose.
A care need is a reasonable care need if:
It arises as a direct result of the disability of the principal beneficiary; and
It is for the primary benefit of the principal beneficiary; and
It is met in Australia.
A care need is not a reasonable care need if:
It would be required by the principal beneficiary whether or not they had their disability; or
It is met outside Australia.

QLD – INTESTACY PROVISIONS
Under the Succession Act 1981 (Qld) the distribution rules for the residual of the estate of an intestate person are: 1
Circumstances	Way in which the intestate estates is to be distributed
1	Where there was a spouse and no children	The spouse receives the entire estate. Where there is more than one spouse they receive the entire estate in equal shares.
2	Where there was one spouse and children	The spouse receives the household effects of the deceased, plus $150,000 and
(ii) The following part of the balance of the estate: (a) If there is only one child of the intestate
who survived, or who did not survive but left children who survived the intestate, 1/2 share.
(b) Otherwise, 1/3 share.
3	Where the intestate is survived by children and no spouse	(a) If the intestate had only one child and the child survived, the child takes the whole estate.
(b) If the intestate had two or more children, all of whom survived, the children take the whole estate in equal shares.
(c) If the intestate had two or more children, of whom some survived and the remainder did not survive and did not leave surviving children, the surviving children take the whole estate in equal shares.
(d) If subsections (a) to (c) do not apply, the entitlement is divided into as many equal shares as the intestate
had children who survived or who did not survive but left surviving issue.
(e) The equal shares are then taken as follows: (i) The intestate’s surviving children (if any)
take one share each.
(ii) For each child of the intestate who did not survive but left surviving issue, one share is taken by representation by the child’s surviving children
(grandchildren).
4	Where the intestate is not survived by issue but is survived by a parent or both parents	The parent is entitled to the whole of the residuary estate or, if both parents survive the intestate, the parents are entitled to the whole of the residuary estate in equal shares.
5	Where the intestate is not survived by issue or by a parent but is survived by next of kin such as siblings of the intestate (or their children ie. nieces/nephews)	The siblings (or their children, if the sibling has not survived the intestate) are entitled to the estate in equal shares
6	Where there is no other next of kin of the intestate aside from grandparents	The grandparents receive the entire estate
7	Where there is no other next of kin of the intestate aside from uncles and/or aunts	The uncles/aunts receive the entire estate
8	Where there is no other next of kin of the intestate aside from first cousins	The first cousins receive the entire estate
9	Where the intestate is not survived by any children, parents or by next of kin	The Crown is entitled to the entire estate.

Some other aspects to note:
Where a person entitled to take any part of the residuary estate of an intestate does not survive the intestate individual for a period of at least 30 days, that part of the residuary estate is treated as if that person had pre-deceased the intestate. Section 35 Succession Act 1981 (Qld).2
Where adequate provision is not made from the estate for the proper maintenance and support of the deceased person's spouse, child or dependant, the courts may order that such provision be made. However, in doing so the courts will need to be satisfied that the dependant was being maintained or supported by the deceased prior to their death and that such a need for assistance continues after their death. Section 41 Succession Act 1981 (Qld).3
A spouse may be either a husband/wife or a de-facto spouse. To be considered a de-facto spouse, the deceased and the other person (including a person of the same sex) must have lived as a couple on a genuine domestic basis for at least two years ending on the death of the deceased. Section 32DA Acts Interpretation Act 1954 (Qld).4

1. Schedule 2 Succession Act 1981 (Qld)
2. Section 35 Succession Act 1981 (Qld)

FACTORS TO BE AWARE OF
Wrap accounts have tiered administration charges which are determined based on the value of the portfolio split across cash and investments assets. Regular payments or lump sum withdrawals taken from the Wrap account can in effect increase the proportional costs of the Wrap account. Lower value accounts may become uneconomic.
Client-held assets (such as direct property, artwork, etc.) will not be held in custody by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited (PTCo). The assets will remain registered as per your own arrangements. These assets, however, can be recorded and reported in your Wrap account, to provide you with a complete picture of your overall portfolio.
As these client-held assets will not be held in custody by PTCo, transactional and capital gains tax information will not be recorded for these assets and is therefore unable to be provided. The value provided in your portfolio reports will be the latest value provided to us, by you.
Transaction fees may be payable when buy or selling assets within the Wrap account. However the first transactions per month are free.
A minimum level of cash $2,500 must be maintained in the cash account at all times.
If you decide to close your account in the future some investments e.g. wholesale investments may not be able to be transferred to your name and you may need to redeem the investment to cash. This may trigger a capital gains event.
If you decide that you do not wish to receive advice in the future from us you can elect to move to an alternative service. This will allow you to continue to operate your Wrap account.
The majority of instructions (such as investment purchases and sales) will need to be implemented through an adviser. The online access that is provided will not allow instructions to be placed directly with the wrap provider.
The range of investments offered through the Wrap have been selected for inclusion on the Wrap investment menu as a direct result of their inclusion from our core investment philosophy and Approved Product List which is governed by the PTCo Investment Committee. I.e. our advice is not limited by the Wrap investment menu, the Wrap investment menu reflects and supports our advice. The investment committee is made up of senior Perpetual investment specialists and staff.
The PTCo Investment Committee will consider a range of factors when selecting specific investments
on the Wrap investment menu, including market conditions, liquidity, asset allocation and diversification, research recommendations and the standard risk measures; They may also consider if there are any administrative or technological factors that influence selection.
Please note that Perpetual will need to have a Power of Attorney (POA) from you to enable the efficient administration of your portfolio. However, it is important to note that for any alterations to your investments, instructions need to be authorised by you before implementation of any changes can be made when using the Advisory or custody services.

ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENTS
The following provides commentaries on the recommended investments.
CASH
A cash investment involves lending money for short periods of time. Cash investments can include bank deposits, term deposits and short-term bank bills. Cash provides a relatively consistent rate of return in the form of regular interest payments, generally in line with short-term interest rates and is widely considered the lowest risk investment. Easily accessible, cash provides a buffer against unforeseen expenses and for funding new investment opportunities (eg participating in rights issues or new floats).
We believe our clients’ cash exposure should comprise a strategic mix of cash-at-call, enhanced cash and term deposits. This mix of strategies will achieve an appropriate level of diversification across short term fixed interest (and money market) securities to provide required liquidity to manage day-to-day operations and funding new purchases. We [recommend,propose] achieving this target asset allocation for [your,the] portfolio’s strategic cash exposure via the following funds:
Manager	Style
Perpetual Cash Account	Cash
Perpetual High Grade Treasury Fund	Enhanced Cash (Strategic)
Term deposit (6-months and below maturity)	Term Deposit
Cash management funds/trusts normally provide access to cash within 24 hours. Therefore they can be used as a convenient source of liquidity to pay for portfolio expenses. It can also be used as a receptacle into which investment and other income is placed. The fund holds short term government and bank backed securities, and bank deposits, which are normally considered to have a very low risk of capital loss.
High grade treasury funds provide investors with regular income by investing in cash deposits, money market, fixed interest and debt-like hybrid securities. The strategy invests in a diversified portfolio of securities which has additional credit exposure and forgoes some liquidity in order to target a higher return profile than more traditional cash funds. We believe this strategy would be best employed for strategic allocations of cash that will be held for more than 12 months.
Where term deposits are used in a portfolio’s strategic asset allocation to cash, we [recommend,propose] the term to be no more than 180 days in order to allow relatively easy access to those funds. While term deposits have benefits, there are a number of issues that need to be appropriately managed. Term deposits should be considered ‘illiquid’ and entered into with a view to holding until maturity. Although a term deposit can be ‘collected’ prior to the maturity date, doing so often leads to interest being forfeited, defeating the purpose of the investment.
AUSTRALIAN FIXED INTEREST
A fixed interest investment involves lending money for a fixed period by investing in securities that pay interest at a specified rate, payable at fixed periods, with the original investment being repayable at a date in the future. Fixed interest investments provide stable, regular income with the potential for growth of capital in periods of declining interest rates, or loss of capital if interest rates rise. Fixed interest investments play an important role in a portfolio. In addition to providing a regular income stream, an important feature for many investors, fixed interest securities can provide a stabilising effect during periods of share market volatility.
The Australian fixed investment universe consists of a range of long term ‘debt’ securities such as government and corporate bonds which can be traded on the secondary market in order to make a profit. By managing these exposures through periods of interest rate fluctuations, an investment manager is able to add value for unit holders over longer time periods. This ‘value add’ process results in the capital value of a bond being subject to volatility when interest rates vary.
Australian fixed interest can also include other instruments which include diversified income and various other hybrid securities. Diversified income are assets in which the coupon of the investment increases with rising interest rates. Examples include some mortgages, hybrid security issues and overseas bank floating rate notes (hedged back to Australian dollars). Hybrid securities exhibit characteristics of both debt and equity. Typically, these provide an attractive return when compared to traditional fixed interest securities and may include an option to convert into fully paid shares of the issuing company, subject to the meeting of specific criteria.
Hybrids also add value by paying consistent income streams, often with franking credits attached to the dividends, thus making the income relatively tax effective. Importantly, hybrids provide an avenue to increase diversification within the fixed interest asset class because they exhibit low correlation of returns with both traditional bonds and mortgages.
We [recommend,propose] obtaining exposure to this asset class via four funds. They include the following:
Manager	Style
Schroder Fixed Income Fund	Active
Macquarie Income Opportunities Fund	High Yield
Perpetual Wholesale Diversified Income Fund	Active
GAM Absolute Return Bond Fund	Absolute
INTERNATIONAL FIXED INTEREST
International fixed interest securities are suitable for investors who require capital preservation and stable income but are comfortable with medium to low volatility over a full market cycle. The sector is traditionally more defensive relative to other sectors such shares, given the bias of the sector towards government bonds and defensive corporate credit securities.
The performance from international fixed interest securities are driven a number of factors but generally movements across global interest rates as well as by the underlying credit risk of corporate bonds have tended to be key drivers. International fixed interest strategies can therefore add value through the use of duration and yield curve management, credit selection and sector rotation decisions. We currently recommend active management for the asset class given the opportunities for managers to outperform over the medium term.
The PIMCO Diversified Fixed Interest Fund is our only [recommended,proposed] manager for this sector.
Manager	Style
PIMCO Diversified Fixed Interest Fund	Active
IMPLEMENTED FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO
The Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio has a composite benchmark comprised of 50 percent against the Bloomberg AusBond Composite Index and 50 percent against the Bloomberg AusBond Bank Bills Index.
The portfolio is biased towards managers who combine top-down macroeconomic research and fundamental bottom-up analysis for sector positioning across industries, positioning across the yield curve and for security selection. They have a repeatable investment process, operate within an appropriate risk management framework and operate in an aligned and stable organisational structure. We believe these factors best deliver a stable outcome of returns within a multi-manager framework.
At this point in time, the Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio uses the strategies of managers that focus on investing mainly within the Australian Fixed and Floating Interest rate markets, with a limited scope to opportunistically invest in global markets. The Australian focus of the Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio strategy is deliberate to mitigate exposure to global developed fixed interest markets where sovereign bond yields are at historic lows and offer little risk adjusted value for Australian based investors. This may change over time. The Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio is designed with the flexibility to allow for an increased exposure to global fixed and floating interest markets and strategies as valuations become more attractive in the future.
The managers within the Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio will invest across the broad spectrum of available debt instruments diversified by industry, maturity and credit rating (the majority of which will be investment grade as assigned by a recognised global ratings agency). Their portfolios tend to be diversified across hundreds of positions both in physical securities and through the use of derivatives. The diversified nature of their portfolios aims for the delivery of consistent returns above their designated benchmarks and acts to mitigate a large negative portfolio impact from any single position that may underperform from time to time.
The Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio blends a small group of managers that construct well diversified portfolios, who have a long-term and consistent track record, are expected to continue to deliver on this track record, and whose investment styles complement each other well. Consistency and complimentary of return profiles are of critical importance such that we can comfortably blend managers to deliver consistent and stable outperformance above the benchmark.
Therefore, we [recommend,propose] the introduction of the Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio. This investment provides diversification through a number of underlying specialist fixed income managers. Perpetual’s specialised investment team are responsible for managing this investment and for reporting on investment performance and activity.
Given the broad diversification of managers across Australian fixed interest, floating rate credit and international fixed interest and flexibility within the Implemented Fixed Income Portfolio the exposure to Australian and international fixed interest will be managed to meet the total benchmark exposure for the combined fixed interest asset class.
PROPERTY
Property securities combine growth and income asset attributes, traditionally providing capital growth potential with lower risk than shares. The diverse and illiquid nature of property and the complexity of the underlying financial structures suggest the managed fund approach should provide a more predictable pattern of returns when compared to direct investments in this asset class.
We [recommend,propose] exposure to the various property sub-sectors in the ratio of 50% Australian real estate investment trusts (A-REITs) and 50% global real estate investment trusts (G-REITs). Some of the major reasons behind this are limited breadth of the A-REIT sector, the wider opportunity set and higher growth prospects of the global market and the potential for higher returns and lower relative volatility from direct property.
We believe that the most effective investment vehicle to obtain this target asset allocation to the property sector within your portfolio is via a strategic mix of active managers.
Manager	Style
Fidelity Australian Equities Fund	Active A-REITS
Resolution Global Property Fund	Active A-REITS
BT Wholesale Global Property Securities Fund	Active A-REITS
IMPLEMENTED REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO
The Implemented Real Estate Portfolio has a composite benchmark comprised of 50 percent against the S&P/ASX 300 Australian REIT* Accumulation Index and 50 percent against the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed (Hedged in AUD) Index.

The portfolio invests with managers who are fundamental bottom-up stock pickers, have a repeatable investment process, operate within an appropriate risk management framework and operate in an aligned and stable organisational structure. We believe these factors best deliver a stable outcome of returns within a multi-manager framework.
The Implemented Real Estate Portfolio uses two broad market managers that respectively invest across the entire market capitalisation spectrum of the domestic and global REIT markets. That includes large, mid and small REITs by market capitalisation.
The portfolio managed by the domestic REIT manager will tend to be diversified in nature as it relates to the domestic benchmark and typically hold anywhere between 15-25 Australian REITs. The portfolio managed by the global REIT manager will typically be concentrated in nature as it relates to the global benchmark, holding anywhere between 30-50 global REITs.  This allows for the Property Implemented Portfolio Fund to access this managers’ high conviction stock picking decisions across what is a broader global REIT universe when compared to the domestic REIT universe.
The Implemented Real Estate Portfolio blends the above mentioned managers, targeting managers who have a long term and consistent track record, are expected to continue to deliver on this track record, and whose investment styles complement each other well. Consistency of return profiles are of paramount importance such that we can comfortably blend managers who we believe will continue to complement each other well. The end result is the creation of a Property Implemented Fund that aims to have an overall volatility below that of the composite benchmark.
*Real Estate Investment Trust
Therefore, we [recommend,propose] the introduction of the Implemented Real Estate Portfolio. This investment provides diversification though in a number of underlying specialist property fund managers. Perpetual’s specialised investment team are responsible for managing this investment and for reporting on investment performance and activity.
AUSTRALIAN SHARES
We believe [your,the portfolio's] Australian shares exposure should comprise a mix of value and growth style with income focused funds. The [recommended,proposed] model portfolio exhibits a 'neutral style' with a skew towards value, which is consistent with our 'managed funds' process that emphasises quality and value. We are [recommending,proposing] a new model portfolio consisting of:
Manager	Style
Fidelity Australian Equities Fund	Growth
Perpetual Wholesale Concentrated Fund	Value
Schroder Australian Equity Fund	Neutral
Perpetual Pure Value Fund	All Cap
Ironbark Karara Australian Small Companies Fund	Small Cap
This portfolio has been selected to suit the current and expected Australian share environment, with strengths across market sectors (both industrials and resources) and capabilities in deriving value from the current difficult macroeconomic environment and stock selection. The [recommended,proposed] model portfolio exhibits a ‘neutral style’ with a skew towards value, which is consistent with our ‘managed funds’ process that emphasises quality and value.
As part of the value proposition of protecting wealth and delivering consistent income, we have added an equity income manager for this risk profiles. We have a preference of managers that combine listed Australian equities with derivatives. These managers invest in a range of Australian shares that are expected to provide consistent income streams, through dividend and franking credits, with capital growth. In addition, these managers will overlay the long only portfolio with a ‘Buy-write’ strategy (combination of long stock and sold call).
IMPLEMENTED AUSTRALIAN SHARE PORTFOLIO
The Implemented Australian Share Portfolio is benchmarked against the S&P/ASX 300 Accumulation Index.
The portfolio is biased towards managers who are fundamental bottom-up stock pickers, have a repeatable investment process, operate within an appropriate risk management framework and operate in an aligned and stable organisational structure. We believe these factors best deliver a stable outcome of returns within a multi-manager framework.
The Implemented Australian Share Portfolio uses broad market managers that invest across the entire market capitalisation spectrum of the domestic equity market that includes large, mid and small companies by market capitalisation. Their portfolios tend to be concentrated in nature and hold anywhere between 30-50 companies.
The concentrated nature of their portfolios allows for the Australian Shares Implemented Portfolio to access these managers’ high conviction stock picking decisions. This lowers the degree of overlap across securities in each portfolio and lowers the risk of over diversification, which is an issue as it relates to Australian Shares due to the large company dominance of the domestic share market.
The Implemented Australian Share Portfolio will typically also use one to two small company dedicated specialist managers with focused strategies across the small company segment of the share market. This is a relatively inefficient part of the domestic share market where we feel a targeted and specialist approach is warranted. The exposure to small company specialist managers as a whole is typically held in line with the exposure of the small company segment of the share market to the overall share market by capitalisation.
The Implemented Australian Share Portfolio blends the above mentioned group of managers, targeting managers who have a long term and consistent track record, are expected to continue to deliver on this track record, and whose investment styles complement each other well. Consistency of return profiles are of paramount importance such that we can comfortably blend managers who we believe will continue to complement each other well. The end result is the creation of an Implemented Australian Share Portfolio that aims to have an overall volatility below that of the broader benchmark.
Therefore, we [recommend,propose] the introduction of the Implemented Australian Shares Portfolio. This investment provides diversification though in a number of underlying specialist Australian share fund managers. Perpetual’s specialised investment team are responsible for managing this investment and for reporting on investment performance and activity
INTERNATIONAL SHARES
During 2015-2016 the Perpetual Private Investment Research team conducted a review of the International Equity manager universe, including our incumbent managers. The review was aligned with our investment philosophy of preserving capital, accumulating wealth and our core investment belief in achieving these outcomes using active management. The review was biased towards identifying managers that satisfy our quality filters and align with our philosophy and belief; that is, managers with an active, fundamental, bottom-up stock picking approach towards investments.
From a universe of over 250 global managers, our screening process resulted in a short list of 17 global managers, each of which were then subject to thorough and detailed due diligence. Following this, quantitative and qualitative portfolio construction analysis was conducted to ensure the final portfolios are well balanced across managers, investment styles and risk exposures.
We [recommend,propose] the following investments for [your,the] portfolio:
Manager	Portfolio Weighting
Barrow Hanley Global Equity Trust	25
Carnegie WorldWide Global Equity Trust	25
Magellan Global Equity	25
MFS Global Equity	25
INTERNATIONAL SHARE IMPLEMENTED PORTFOLIO
The Implemented International Share Portfolio is benchmarked against the MSCI All Country World Accumulation Index in AUD (unhedged).
The portfolio is biased towards managers who are fundamental bottom-up stock pickers, have a repeatable investment process, operate within an appropriate risk management framework and operate in an aligned and stable organisational structure. We believe these factors best deliver a stable outcome of returns within a multi-manager framework. The Implemented International Share Portfolio combines broad market managers that operate across all industry sectors and geographic regions, including both developed and emerging markets.
These managers are typically grouped across two main categories. The first is those that represent a core exposure, with well diversified portfolios that hold more than 50 companies. These managers tend to exhibit balanced style and sector biases with their portfolios biased towards the larger market capitalisation segment of the global sharemarket. These managers form the largest allocation within the fund. The second category is those managers that offer high conviction concentrated portfolios holding anywhere between 20-50 companies.
These managers have more distinct style and sector biases. Their portfolios are typically biased towards the small-to-medium market capitalisation segment of the global sharemarket and as such are complementary to the core manager exposures.     The Implemented International Share Portfolio blends the above mentioned group of managers, targeting managers who have a long term and consistent track record, are expected to continue to deliver on this track record, and whose investment styles complement each other well. Consistency of return profiles are of paramount importance such that we can comfortably blend managers who we believe will continue to complement each other well. The end result is the creation of an International Shares Implemented Fund that aims to have an overall volatility below that of the broader benchmark.
Therefore we [recommend,propose] the the introduction of the Implemented International Share Portfolio.
ALTERNATIVES
The terms 'Alternative Investments' or so-called 'Opportunistic Investments' include a wide range of investments, all with different drivers of return - but all with the key distinguishing feature of seeking out different sources of return to traditional investments.
Opportunistic investments are most easily defined as investments that either fall outside the more traditional asset classes of exchange traded shares, traded bonds and credit securities, cash or exchange traded listed property trusts, or utilise sophisticated trading strategies, derivatives or short-selling to help achieve their performance objectives.
We recommend an exposure to Opportunistic investments via Perpetual's multi-manager approach to investing, where specialist investment managers are chosen to manage the assets of the fund. This multi-manager approach may reduce the risk associated with using a single specialist investment manager, as an individual specialist investment manager's performance can change over time or with different market conditions. The combination of investment managers with different styles, philosophies, approaches and techniques in selecting their portfolios, could potentially enhance asset diversification and may produce more consistent returns.
Note: Each of the Perpetual Income Opportunities Fund and Perpetual Growth Opportunities Funds are non-liquid managed investment schemes (as defined in the Corporations Act). Withdrawals from the fund can only be made after Perpetual makes a withdrawal offer at the end of every calendar quarter. There is a risk that you will have difficulty withdrawing your investment.
Given the higher liquidity risks associated with the opportunistic investments when compared with funds that invest the majority of their assets in exchange traded markets, you need to understand your own liquidity needs and should not rely on being able to access all of the portion of your investment portfolio that is invested in the Funds at all times.
Opportunistic and illiquid assets are more risky than other types of traditional investments and are suitable only for investors with a long term focus and higher risk tolerance.
Asset classes available through the Perpetual multi-manager approach:
•	Private equity investments – normally comprise investments in unlisted companies and entities that offer the prospect for an escalation in economic value through a range of strategies including product development, market expansion, mergers and acquisitions and corporate and balance sheet restructuring.
•	Opportunistic property investments comprise investments in the real estate equivalent of unlisted private equity. Such investments seek returns by investing in property projects with a potential escalation in economic value, mainly via major redevelopment or repositioning of the asset.
•	Absolute return investments – investments that could display characteristics of either income or growth investments, depending on the actual underlying assets and investment techniques used by the investment managers. Absolute return funds are actively managed investments that aim to produce returns in both rising and falling markets by using a broad range of securities and investment techniques. These techniques include the use of derivatives, hedging (where the manager uses two or more securities that are likely to move in opposition to each other), short selling, investments in exotic and/or low-liquidity securities and leverage (where the fund manager borrows or gears the fund’s assets).
•	Infrastructure investments – investments that involve purchasing listed or unlisted equity or debt securities in companies and/or large projects that provide facilities and services needed by the community (e.g., transport, power, roads, telecommunications or water supply), or in other capital intensive assets (e.g., regional infrastructure).
•	Cash investments – investments that include discount securities (e.g., bank bills), short-term deposits and money market funds which may invest in fixed income instruments and loans.
•	Enhanced cash investments – investments that include cash investments, fixed income instruments, hybrids, loans and other income generating securities. The maturity dates of investments are typically longer than cash and they may have a lower credit rating than those in a money market fund, however, they are usually managed to short interest rate exposures.
There are also various other asset types that do not fall within any particular category outlined above. Some examples of ‘other’ investment strategies may include:
•	Timberland investments that comprise mainly tree farms and managed natural forests.
•	Emerging markets debt investments that include mainly bonds issued by developing countries.
•	Private equity mezzanine debt strategies that invest in subordinated debt that takes priority over equity but ranks after (is ‘subordinate’ to) senior debt.
Therefore, we <<recommend,propose>> the introduction of the Perpetual Income Opportunities Fund and the Perpetual Growth Opportunities Fund.
